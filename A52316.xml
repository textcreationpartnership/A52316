            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Your <hi>Traditions</hi> ſay, Diſhonour him by Diſobedience; Inſinuate <hi>Jealouſies</hi> and evil Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſings concerning him and his <hi>Government.</hi> Your <hi>Actions</hi> are a thouſand Tongues, and every Tongue a <hi>Trumpet</hi> to Proclaim your thoughts. And however with your <hi>Lips</hi> you may pretend to honour the <hi>King,</hi> and with your <hi>Mouths</hi> to draw near to <hi>God,</hi> your <hi>Heart</hi> is, in reality, far from both: Your <hi>Will</hi> is your <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Idol</hi> of your <hi>Heart,</hi> which you ſet up and Worſhip.</p>
            <p>For what, I pray, is your way of Worſhip, but <hi>Tradition</hi> from the <hi>Heads</hi> of your <hi>Party?</hi> Is there ever a Word in <hi>Scripture</hi> for your long

               <hi>Extempore Prayers,</hi> full, not of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerabiles ineptiae,</hi> with which <hi>Calvin</hi> charges our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> but of Intoller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Tautologies, vain Repetitions, raſh Expreſſions, and indigeſted Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Chriſt is Poſitive againſt them; Uſe them not, ſays he, as the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> who think to be heard for their <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>Is the Scripture clear, that there ought to be no <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the <hi>Church?</hi> Or that <hi>Lay-Elders,</hi> who underſtand neither Senſe, nor it may be <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and in ſome places, who cannot write their <hi>Name,</hi> ſhould yet be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to <hi>Define</hi> and <hi>Determine</hi> in Matters of <hi>Faith?</hi> Are you any where forbidden to wear a <hi>Surplice;</hi> or to uſe the <hi>Sign</hi> of the <hi>Croſs;</hi> or to
<pb facs="tcp:56949:7"/>bury <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in hope of <hi>Charity,</hi> and Reſurrection to <hi>Eternal</hi> Life? Or to pray in ſet and appointed Words, which is true praying by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> when we pray with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding alſo, knowing what will be ſaid? If theſe be not <hi>Gods</hi> Commands or Prohibitions, they are Yours; and if they are not in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> as I am ſure they are not, they are not only the Commandments and <hi>Traditions</hi> of Men; but of Men, who have no Power to Command, or Impoſe the moſt indifferent thing. And yet you perſwade all Men, every where, that they owe <hi>Obedience</hi> to theſe; forgetting that <hi>God</hi> is to be Obeyed rather than Men; and that he commands you to <hi>Obey</hi> thoſe that have the <hi>Rule</hi> over you.</p>
            <p>If you will be Followers of <hi>God</hi> as Dear Children, you muſt, if it be poſſible, and as much as in you lies, be Followers of <hi>Peace</hi> with all Men; much more with your Superiors, both in Church and

               <p>THIS is the true <hi>Reaſon</hi> why any perſon finds it ſo difficult to quit thoſe <hi>Notions of Religion,</hi> which have been Eſtabliſhed in his Mind from his Early <hi>Infancy:</hi> there is a Marvellous Agreement, and Natural Kindneſs to thoſe <hi>Opinions</hi> which we ſuck in with our <hi>Milk;</hi> they are like <hi>Foſter Brothers,</hi> to whom it has been obſerved, there is as ſtrong an inclination as to the <hi>Natural;</hi> we play and converſe with them from our <hi>Cradles,</hi> and as ſoon as we can go alone, we take them by the <hi>hand;</hi> we ſleep with them in our boſoms, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract an inſenſible <hi>Friendſhip</hi> with them, a pleaſing <hi>Familiarity,</hi> which takes off all deformities; we love them, and we like them, and their very blackneſs is a <hi>Beauty,</hi> as it is with the <hi>Affrican Nations,</hi> to whom even that which we judge deformity, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears more lovely than the moſt delicate <hi>Europaean Beauty.</hi> What can be more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and ridiculous than the <hi>Alchoran</hi> of that great <hi>Impoſtor, Mahumed?</hi> and yet a

               </p>
               <p>WHAT can be more Barbarous and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, than the <hi>Rites</hi> of the <hi>Pagan Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?</hi> and yet, you may almoſt as ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move a <hi>Mountain,</hi> as one of them, from what has been the <hi>Religion</hi> of his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors;</hi> and his, ever ſince he knew any.

               </p>
               <p>WHAT can be more hard and cruel, than for thoſe who profeſs to be of the <hi>Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion,</hi> to run to the very extremities of ruining themſelves, by mutual <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions?</hi> and ſo far to weaken themſelves and diſparage their <hi>Religion</hi> by inteſtine Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, to open an eaſy way for <hi>Conqueſt</hi> to the Enemies both of our <hi>Religion and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;</hi> for ſome differences in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of <hi>Divine Worſhip?</hi> And yet we ſee, ſuch is the ſtrength of ſome mens <hi>preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices,</hi> and the education of others, in the late unhappy times of our <hi>Miſery</hi> and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, (from which we were reſcued by ſo many <hi>Miracles</hi>) that they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther venture upon the ſame <hi>tempeſtuous</hi> Sea again, from whence we have ſo lately eſcaped <hi>ſhipwrack;</hi> nay uſe all <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi> to puſh men headlong from the Shoar, into the foaming Main again, which they have but juſt recovered, ſtill wet and ſhivering, rather than by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the <hi>modeſt</hi> commands of the wiſe <hi>Pilots,</hi> their lawful Superiors, even in the moſt indifferent things, endeavour to repair the leaky <hi>veſſel</hi> of the <hi>Church

               <p>WHERE <hi>Intereſt</hi> combined with <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi> have taken deep Root, they are very hard to be overcome, or extirpated from the Minds of Men; but there are two things yet behind, which are more ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, becauſe more <hi>natural</hi> to us; as being uſually interwoven with the very <hi>Tempers</hi> of our <hi>Nature,</hi> the Vices of our <hi>Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> as well as contracted with time. For no Man is born with any Deſigns in his head, nor are <hi>Prejudices</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms, éx traduce,</hi> derived from our <hi>Parents:</hi> but <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> are Vices to which the very Conſtitutions of ſome mens <hi>bodies</hi> do more powerfully incline them; ſome <hi>Natures</hi> are infected with hot and tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary <hi>Spirits,</hi> a reſtleſs and a boiling Blood, impatient of the <hi>Rein</hi> of Government, as the Poet long ago obſerved in his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of Youth, <hi>Caereus invitium flecti, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitoribus aſper:</hi> and it is deſcernable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times in the Earlieſt Sallies of <hi>Life,</hi> and ſo ſoon as Reaſon begins to ſhew it ſelf, <hi>Pride and Ambition</hi> begin to appear and diſcover themſelves; thus you ſhall ſee ſome <hi>Natures</hi> Meek and Malleable, ſoft and tender; others, as if with <hi>Romulus</hi> they had ſuck't the Wolf, will like him, play the <hi>King</hi> amongſt their Companions;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56949:32"/>and at that Age, are ſo ambitious of the little Honours, and Superiorities above their <hi>Equals</hi> in Age, and ſometimes their Superiors in <hi>Quality,</hi> that they will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the ſeverities of the <hi>Ferula,</hi> and their Blood too, in the Quarrel, to be <hi>Caeſar aut nullus:</hi> and there is ſcarcely a Publique <hi>School,</hi> where one may not be furniſhed with a <hi>Specimen</hi> of this <hi>Nature.</hi> Now to ſubdue theſe <hi>congenial</hi> Inclinations, does doubtleſs require not only the greateſt force of <hi>Virtue,</hi> but the greateſt ſtock of <hi>Grace:</hi> and many times without the laſt, all the power of the firſt proves too weak a <hi>Dam</hi> to ſtop theſe impetuous <hi>Torrents</hi> of <hi>Natural Ambition,</hi> and <hi>Pride,</hi> when ſwell'd with the <hi>Tides</hi> of inviting and feazible <hi>Temptations;</hi> and violently raiſed above their Shoars, with the turbulent Air of <hi>Popular breath;</hi> the moſt dangerous <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt</hi> that can blow upon theſe ſwelling and foaming <hi>Waves.</hi>

               <p>I joyn theſe two together, becauſe they are ſeldom found aſunder; and it is not common to find a proud man that is not <hi>Ambitious,</hi> or an <hi>Ambitious</hi> perſon that is not <hi>proud;</hi> and one can rarely be tempted by one, without the aſſiſtance of the other, and if they be not <hi>Twins,</hi> I cannot decide their Pretenſions which ſhould be the Elder Brother; but which ſoever is the firſt born of <hi>Folly, Pride</hi> uſually ſets <hi>Ambition</hi> upon

               <p>THE <hi>Nature</hi> of Pride and Ambition is always to Eſtabliſh its own Greatneſs upon the <hi>Ruine</hi> of whatſoever does oppoſe them; and by all ways and means to leſſen others, in order to greaten themſelves; that ſo by trampling upon the necks of their <hi>Enemies,</hi> they may Exalt their own <hi>Power and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem:</hi> and becauſe there is nothing that does Elevate men to that degree of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in the Minds of the <hi>Multitude,</hi> like an <hi>Opinion</hi> of their <hi>Sanctity</hi> and Devotion; therefore it is, that this is the beloved <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine</hi> which <hi>Ambitious</hi> Minds make uſe of, to carry on, cover, and effect their own
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56949:35"/>Deſigns of Greatneſs, by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Popular Tumults;</hi> which they uſually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage like <hi>Elephants,</hi> by ſhewing them the Scarlet <hi>Robes</hi> both of the <hi>Prince and Prieſt,</hi> as objects of hatred; to animate and inflame them againſt thoſe <hi>Sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> by whom they are worn.</p>
               <p>I might confirm this by many Forrein <hi>Inſtances,</hi> but I rather chuſe one at home; both becauſe it nearly concerns us, and ought to make the greater <hi>Impreſſion</hi> upon us: The late Uſurper <hi>Cromwel,</hi> was in this Art ſo perfect and accompliſht, as not to deſerve to be undervalued as a <hi>Copy,</hi> but Eſteemed an <hi>Original of Pride, Hypocriſie, and Ambition.</hi> One would admire that <hi>People,</hi> who many of them knew the Man and his Converſation; who ſaw the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Diſguiſe</hi> of his Diſſimulation and Flattery thrown off by his own hands; who are ſenſible how by this only <hi>Artiſice</hi> of pretending <hi>Religion</hi> (though by the aſſiſtance of their Blood and Money) he threw down the peacable Government both of <hi>Church and State;</hi> how by a bloody <hi>Civil</hi> War, and the Murther of his <hi>Royal Maſter,</hi> he himſelf aſpired to the <hi>Throne;</hi> and how he Eſtabliſhed an <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Tyranny,</hi> againſt which he pretended, and made the <hi>People</hi> believe he fought; and how to the great affliction of all <hi>Parties,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> he took away

               <p>HE was a <hi>Perſon</hi> who in the firſt ſallies of his Youth, was Debauched even to the <hi>Terror</hi> of all the <hi>Villages</hi> of the <hi>Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;</hi> who were uſed to give the <hi>Allarm</hi> when they ſaw him at a diſtance, with <hi>Look to your ſelves, here comes Mad</hi> Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56949:36"/>his great <hi>Frolique</hi> was the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Glaſs Windows, which he perſiſted in to his laſt, beginning with thoſe of Cottages, and not ſparing at laſt thoſe of Churches; when his <hi>Debauchery</hi> only chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the <hi>Name</hi> but not the <hi>Nature,</hi> and one was the Effect of <hi>Wine,</hi> the other of his <hi>Drunken Zeal.</hi> Having run the ſmall <hi>Barque</hi> of his Fortune aground by his profuſion, he begun to think how to get her off again; and finding that impoſſible, he imbarqued himſelf into the Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Friendſhip of one <hi>Tims</hi> of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> an Eminently diſaffected perſon to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Government;</hi> and being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally of a quick and ſagacious Spirit, he eaſily found the ſoft place in the head of <hi>Tims,</hi> who was the head of the <hi>Faction</hi> thereabouts; and believing, that if he could but act, a <hi>Convert</hi> to the Life, he might thereby get a Livelyhood, and by ſwimming down their ſtream, buoy up his ſinking Fortune, by fiſhing in the Waters which they troubled; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore joyned himſelf to their Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and becauſe his <hi>Reformation</hi> was Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, he did not doubt, but, for the <hi>Credit</hi> he did their powerful <hi>Göſpel,</hi> they would pay him for a <hi>Miracle</hi> of ſo great uſe and advantage for their intended <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> which being then a brewing, he might be lookt upon as a neceſſary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument

               <p>BUT what is obſervable of him, after he had pray'd the <hi>Kings Crown</hi> off his head, and his head from his <hi>Body,</hi> and the power

               </p>
               <p>IN ſhort, he made the ſame uſe of this curious <hi>Network</hi> of his pregnant Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which'tis ſaid a certain <hi>Cardinal</hi> did of that <hi>Net</hi> which he always uſed to ſpread upon his <hi>Table;</hi> alledging for his humour, that it put him in mind of his <hi>Apoſtplical Function,</hi> which was to be a <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher of Men,</hi> but coming to be poſſeſſed of the <hi>Triple Crown,</hi> the Net was no longer

               </p>
               <p>Thus did our Engliſh <hi>Maſſaniello,</hi> by the pretence of <hi>Sanctity</hi> and <hi>Non-conformity,</hi> by the help of <hi>long Prayers</hi> and a longer Sword; by the promiſes of <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> Liberty of the Subject, propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Truth,</hi> and giving the <hi>Goſpel</hi> a free courſe that it might run and be Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; by the help of new <hi>Goſpel Lights</hi> and <hi>Revelations</hi> which ſhone in his <hi>Army;</hi> by theſe <hi>Arts</hi> did he advance himſelf to the moſt unlimitted <hi>Power</hi> over Laws, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, Life, Eſtate and Religion, to that degree, that a look from him, like <hi>Plinies Baſilisk,</hi> was death even to his fellow <hi>Snakes,</hi> and as if with <hi>Mithridates</hi> he had liv'd upon <hi>Poyſon,</hi> his very breath was <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> not only to the <hi>Royal Party,</hi> but to thoſe who had ſometime been of his own; and even to bodies <hi>Politick,</hi> the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which he call'd <hi>Parliaments,</hi> one of which <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> I remember, exceeding the Limits he had ſet them (a free debate being then no <hi>Priviledg</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi>) <hi>he ſwore by the Living God</hi> (a <hi>venial ſin</hi> in ſo great a <hi>Saint</hi>) <hi>he would diſſolve them,</hi>

               <q>Tantum potuit Religio Suadere Malorum.</q>
               <p>THIS is a ſufficient <hi>Caution</hi> to all People not to truſt their Lives, Liberties, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, or Religion, to the <hi>Protection</hi> of ſuch <hi>Prayers,</hi> and Pretenders to Piety, Zeal, Reformation and Sanctity.</p>
               <p>I know ſuch inſtances are rare, and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi> does not uſually prove ſo fortunate; but this it never fails of, to make the Lives of thoſe with whom it dwells, <hi>uneaſie</hi> to themſelves and others, and if it happens among men of the Church, it certainly occaſions great <hi>Commotions,</hi> the breach of <hi>Peace,</hi> and loſs of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity:</hi> And if we ſearch the Records of Church-<hi>hiſtory,</hi> we ſhall find that moſt of the <hi>Schiſms and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:56949:39"/>which have occaſioned thoſe Great Diſorders, drew their <hi>Original</hi> from the <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> of the diſcontented <hi>Clergy:</hi> for nothing is more natural than for ſuch Perſons, where want of <hi>Temper</hi> renders them moſt unfit for Government in the Church, to be moſt deſirous of it, and to believe they beſt deſerve it; if they fail in their <hi>Expectations,</hi> which it is more than probable they will, being meaſured by the <hi>Standard</hi> of the Sober and Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and not by their own <hi>flattery</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, preſently they fall into diſcontent, and endeavour to obtain that Eſteem and <hi>Authority</hi> by unlawful <hi>Methods,</hi> which they could not arrive at in the regular, modeſt, and peaceable ways of <hi>Order</hi> and obedience. This diſcontent puſhes them violently forward, to be revenged of thoſe who, by not advancing them, they think <hi>depreſs</hi> them, or by advancing others, they believe deſpiſe and diſparage them; and at the ſame time they endeavour to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their <hi>Ambition</hi> and Revenge by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting themſelves.</p>
               <p>Now there are no Arts which they can more ſucceſsfully uſe to accompliſh their <hi>deſign,</hi> than theſe which follow.</p>
               <p>FIRST, to appear more ſtrict, holy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, and righteous, than thoſe whom they call their <hi>Enemies,</hi> who ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be thought <hi>ill</hi> themſelves, for not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56949:40"/>thoſe who appear ſo <hi>good:</hi> And by this means they ſhall certainly be ſo eſteemed by ſuch who look no further, and indeed cannot diſcover the <hi>Depth</hi> of their hearts, or the ſecret <hi>malice</hi> that lodges ſo cloſely there. This preſently creates them a <hi>Name,</hi> and wins them a <hi>Party,</hi> who ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate their <hi>Fame,</hi> ſing <hi>Hoſannas</hi> in their Praiſe, Eſpouſe them, their Intereſt, and their <hi>Quarrel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SECONDLY, That they may appear more than <hi>common,</hi> and difference their <hi>Party</hi> from the reſt, thereby to keep them to themſelves, they muſt broach ſome new <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or revive ſome <hi>old one;</hi> there muſt be an <hi>Altar</hi> erected, and though it be <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; yet will there never want ſome, who will ignorantly Worſhip the ſtranger God, and entertain the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Deity;</hi> then muſt the <hi>old Rites</hi> and manner of <hi>Worſhip</hi> be exploded, to make room for the <hi>New;</hi> and though a man may truly ſay of them, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> of the <hi>Wine, the old is better than the new,</hi> ſo unſettled, unfermented, and full of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous Spirits, that it flies, and froths, and and foams, breaks the <hi>old Bottles</hi> into which it is put; yet will even this <hi>Wine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fret,</hi> pleaſe ſome <hi>Capricious Palates</hi> better than the <hi>Old.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIRDLY, Then all thoſe who oppoſe them muſt be exclaimed againſt, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56949:40"/>
                  <hi>down;</hi> Eſpecially their lawful Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors and Governors, as <hi>formal</hi> out-of-faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-Chriſtians; all endeavours muſt be uſed to rendred them contemptible and <hi>Odious:</hi> And all this muſt be done out of pure <hi>Zeal</hi> to <hi>Truth;</hi> when in reality, it is out of pure Revenge, and for no other Deſign, than that theſe <hi>Ambitious</hi> Spirits may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their <hi>Pride,</hi> by obtaining that <hi>Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence</hi> by fraud and force, which they can never hope for by any other ways.</p>
               <p>THIS is the true procedure of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ambition,</hi> and which leads directly into the <hi>Red Sea of Blood.</hi> I wiſh moſt hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that all ſober and conſiderative Perſons, who diſſent from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and even thoſe who are principally guilty of our <hi>Diviſions,</hi> would enter into a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Examination,</hi> whether there be not ſome of the furious Spirit which our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> Rebukes in his Diſciples <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 9.54, 55.</note> which puts them upon Deſiring <hi>fire from Heaven upon ſuch as will not recieve them,</hi> and ſince they cannot obtain that, makes them throw about their own <hi>wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire,</hi> to ſet the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth into a <hi>Blaze:</hi> And to help the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, I will give them ſome <hi>Indications</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Spirit,</hi> though lurking never ſo cunningly under the Cloak of <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Piety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND firſt therefore, Diſobedience to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56949:41"/>Lawful Authority, and all the ways which manifeſt that Diſobedience, whether Words or Actions, are certain <hi>Symptoms</hi> of the <hi>Pride</hi> of Mens Hearts, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret <hi>Ambition</hi> of their Minds; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever diſobeys his Superior, does at the ſame time <hi>deſpiſe</hi> him, and whoſoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſes any perſon in <hi>Authority,</hi> does it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is confident he knows more and better what he ought to do, than he who has <hi>Power</hi> to Command him: This is the knowledg which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays <hi>puffeth up, but Charity edifieth:</hi>

               <p>Now to make this appear, we muſt look into the Main End and <hi>Deſign</hi> of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion here in this <hi>Mortal</hi> State of Life, in order to that future Condition of a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Immortality:</hi> and that we may the better apprehend what that is, we muſt conſider the Commands and Precepts of <hi>Religion,</hi> and at what they aim.

               </p>
               <p>in our being good, and doing good; which is the great <hi>Employment</hi> for which we came into the <hi>World.</hi> So that there is a neceſſity of <hi>Religion</hi> in the <hi>World</hi> in order to the happy <hi>poſture</hi> of humane affairs, which all <hi>Mankind</hi> deſire for themſelves, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited <hi>wiſhes;</hi> but are too narrow in their indeavors to promote it in <hi>Common</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56949:47"/>Diſtinct, <hi>Coordinate</hi> (not ſubordinate) Churches: for ſo the <hi>Son of God</hi> calls theſe Seven, which yet were compriſed in the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> and People of one Language, though of diſtinct and ſeparate <hi>Polities,</hi> which ſeems to be that which differences Nations, and not <hi>Languages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SECONDLY, That diſtinct, and ſeveral <hi>Coordinate</hi> Churches, may all be true Churches, and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited</hi> in the Common Bond of the ſame <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> who yet may not be of equal <hi>Purity:</hi> two only are here commended for their <hi>Purity,</hi> viz. <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> the other are condemned; <hi>Epheſus,</hi> for having forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken her firſt Love, her <hi>Zeal</hi> and Devotion: <hi>Pergamos,</hi> for the Doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and for ſuffering the odious Sect of the <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laitans: Thyatira,</hi> for ſuffering <hi>Jezebel,</hi> a woman to teach, contrary to the Expreſs Command of God, and therefore to ſeduce the People, by eating things offered to <hi>Idols: Sardis,</hi> for having a name to live, but being dead: <hi>Loadicea,</hi> for being luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm neither hot nor cold, a Church of <hi>Latitudinarians:</hi> all theſe are threatned and reproved, but not rejected from the name and being of <hi>Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIRDLY, That the holy <hi>Catholique Church</hi> is compoſed of ſeveral diſtinct <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> Churches; for we muſt not think the <hi>Son of God</hi> could be guilty of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56949:48"/>of Speech; he diſtinguiſhes them by the places where they were plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by their degrees of <hi>Purity,</hi> as ſo many ſeveral Churches, without giving them any precedency on preheminence one over another: he does not direct the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> of the ſeveral Churches, to <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or <hi>Antioch</hi> (though all then famous Churches) for redreſs of their <hi>Errors;</hi> he does not ſend them to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or his Succeſſors, the <hi>Catholique, Apoſtolique, Roman Church,</hi> as the <hi>Pillar</hi> and Ground of <hi>Truth;</hi> not a word of the <hi>Sancta ſedes Apoſtolica, Petri Cathedra, Eccleſia Principalis,</hi> nothing of the <hi>Romanorum Fides, ad quos perfidia ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere non poteſt acceſſum,</hi> which place of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> boaſt ſo much of, whileſt they indeavour to appropriate the word <hi>Catholique</hi> only to their Church; which is as good ſenſe as that any one man is humane <hi>Nature.</hi> But for the redreſs of their <hi>Errors,</hi> amendment of their Lives, and reformation of their falſe <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi> he gives them all this ſhort <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; He that hath an Ear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches;</hi> and that to every one of them diſtinctly; ſo that what the Spirit of God ſpeaks to the Churches, was to be the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> Life, and Doctrine: and what was it which the Spirit ſpake unto the Churches?
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56949:48"/>was ever any <hi>Tradition</hi> ſaid to be ſpoken by the <hi>Holy Spirit?</hi> No certainly, nothing was ever ſpoken by the <hi>Spirit</hi> to the Churches, but the Books of the <hi>Holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> which all Ages have conſented to, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt <hi>Addition or Diminution</hi> (as the late Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> Dr. <hi>Coſins,</hi> has made appear more diſtinctly) till ſuch time as the <hi>Abſolutiſſima Syndus Tridenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> as they call the <hi>Trent</hi> Seſſion, for ſome paſſages which ſeem favourable to <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and Prayers for the Dead,</hi> was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to adopt theſe into the <hi>Holy Canon;</hi> though nothing is more evident than that till then they were Eſteemed only Humane Writings, and <hi>Apocryphal:</hi> however here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have given a <hi>Specimen</hi> of the Power they pretend over our <hi>Faith;</hi> for by the ſame <hi>Authority</hi> they may impoſe <hi>Aeſops Fables,</hi> and the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> as matters of <hi>Faith.</hi> Neither did the ancient Churches, when <hi>Hereſies</hi> ſprung up, reſort to <hi>Rome</hi> for infallible Determinations, but to <hi>Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical</hi> and <hi>General Councels,</hi> not Eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Determinations valid neither, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs agreeable to the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> which was always accounted the <hi>Norma,</hi> or <hi>Rule</hi> by which they were to be guided: and at which <hi>Councels</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> did aſſiſt, not as the <hi>Head,</hi> but as a <hi>Principal</hi> Member; and the reſpect he had given him was as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch</hi> of the <hi>Imperial City,</hi> and the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56949:49"/>Churches, and not as <hi>Monarch</hi> of the whole <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> and even ſome later <hi>Councels,</hi> as that of <hi>Baſil,</hi> have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to reform <hi>Errors</hi> and Abuſes, and to depoſe the <hi>Pope,</hi> being found guilty of them.</p>
               <p>LASTLY, It may from hence be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf is the only head of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of ſeveral diſtinct <hi>Churches,</hi> who are all Members of that <hi>Myſtical Body:</hi> he walks among the <hi>Candleſticks,</hi> he holds the <hi>Stars</hi> in his right hand; The <hi>Angel</hi> of every diſtinct <hi>National</hi> Church is to be the mover of the <hi>Orb,</hi> to guide it by the Light of <hi>Divine Truth</hi> ſpoken by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Churches; the <hi>Temporal Power</hi> may be Supreme <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, as they are a <hi>Society</hi> of Chriſtian Men; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other, can juſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a Power over the <hi>Angel</hi> of another Church, or the Dominions of another <hi>Prince;</hi> for that is the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the Son of God, who Unites them in his Right hand, and who alone can challenge the <hi>Title</hi> of that Name of <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOR will this <hi>Independency</hi> of Churches one upon another, which is only in point of <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> and Limits, which was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently practiced and commanded by the <hi>Decrees</hi> of Councels, give the leaſt diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56949:49"/>to their Charity and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion;</hi> ſo long as they maintain the ſame Univerſal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Faith</hi> as to the ſubſtance, and all acknowledge one <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> and themſelves Members of it. Nay, it is obſervable that this incroachment of the greater Churches upon the leſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to aggrandize themſelves, by impoſing upon all other Churches a <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty</hi> and Dominion never intended for Chriſtian Religion, and ſtriving by force to oblige them to uſe their <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> in indifferent Circumſtantials; and not only ſo, but to receive all their <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> as matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> were the firſt occaſion of the moſt remarkable <hi>Schiſms</hi> and Diviſions, and the loſs of Peace and Unity; and ſtill continue ſo to this very day.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56949:50"/>of Scripture;</hi> would they ſtudy more to propagate <hi>Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> than Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Soveraignty, to increaſe <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of Life, more than outward agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> the ancient Happineſs of the Church in her firſt and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nambitious Age,</hi> (when the <hi>Office</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was the ſureſt way to <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>) would in a great meaſure be reſtored to the Members of the <hi>Catholique Church;</hi> and there would be that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> which is by <hi>God</hi> Commanded, and by all good <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> not only to be deſired, but promoted to the uttermoſt of their <hi>Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Were it poſſible that this true and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Temper,</hi> Modeſty and Moderation of <hi>Primitive Chriſtianity,</hi> might obtain in the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Names</hi> of diſtinction, with the occaſions of them would be taken away; one would not be of <hi>Paul,</hi> another of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los,</hi> another of <hi>Cephas,</hi> one a <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Calviniſt, Lutheran, Hugonot,</hi> or a <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inglian,</hi> but all would be of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but alas! what hope? ſo long as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> and will exclude all thoſe who Refuſe the <hi>tyranique Yoak</hi> of both her Declared, and <hi>Implicit Faith;</hi> and to be ſubject to her abſolute <hi>Dominion;</hi> not only from the <hi>Name</hi> of Churches, and being Parts of the Church Univerſal, but from the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> from all hopes of the <hi>Reſurrection of the juſt,</hi> nay, even from

               </p>

               <p>FOR, if an <hi>Independency</hi> of Churches of Diſtinct <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>Polities,</hi> ſo long as they agree in matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> may be permitted a diſtinct <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> different <hi>Rites</hi> and manner of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Charity, Peace, and Unity, why may not the ſame be likewiſe practiſed by ſeveral <hi>Churches</hi> in the ſame <hi>Nation?</hi>

For as I may be Lawfully permitted to diſobey the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>France;</hi> nay, and ought to do it in many Caſes for the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> of my <hi>Nation,</hi> but cannot diſobey my <hi>Natural Prince,</hi> but to the prejudice of my <hi>Countrey</hi> and my own, becauſe I owe them no Obedience in point of Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as I do my own <hi>King.</hi> So I may for the ſame <hi>Reaſon</hi> refuſe the Juriſdiction of a Forrein <hi>Church,</hi> but cannot of my own, which has a lawful Power over me,

               </p>
               <p>Now ſince the Light of <hi>Nature, Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> does oblige all men to own this as a neceſſary <hi>Truth,</hi> and thoſe who have oppoſed it, have ever been eſteemed the common Enemies of all <hi>Mankind, Traitors</hi> not only to the Government they have oppoſed, but to the Foundation and Principles of all <hi>Society,</hi> and to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mankind in general: Therefore it is abſolutely neceſſary in any diſtinct <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi> of Men, that the Circumſtances of <hi>Religion</hi> (for the Subſtance of <hi>Faith</hi> is not in the power of any <hi>Mortal man</hi> to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Eſtabliſh) ſhould be adapted to the attainment of this Common <hi>Deſign</hi> of all Government both <hi>Civil and Religious,</hi> the Happineſs of the <hi>Society.</hi> But this is impoſſible to be effected where there are many diſtinct Churches in the ſame <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety?</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:56949:52"/>For either the Supreme <hi>Authority</hi> has Power over them all, or over none at all; if none at all, the <hi>Society</hi> is ruin'd, and he is no longer <hi>King,</hi> nor they own themſelves his Subjects, who deny his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and that they owe him obedience if he has Power over them, it muſt be in Circumſtantials of Government, Order, and the manner of <hi>Divine Worſhip.</hi> Now either he can command them to perform theſe all one way, and then they are no longer diſtinct <hi>Churches,</hi> but the ſame; or he cannot lawfully command them, nor are they bound to <hi>Obey;</hi> and ſo he is no longer their <hi>King,</hi> nor they his <hi>Subjects,</hi> then he obliges them by parting with his <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> and they pleaſe (upon that Condition that he permits them to do what they pleaſe) to afford him their <hi>Subjection.</hi> So that in effect, diſtinct Churches, and Independent upon the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign</hi> in the ſame <hi>Nation,</hi> which is one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire <hi>Body Politick,</hi> are ſo many Spiritual <hi>Electors</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> who own an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> in Name, but are abſolute in Reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Soveraigns within their own Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories and <hi>Dominions.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>FOR anſwer to this at large, I refer them to a ſmall Treatiſe Intitled <hi>The true Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Dominion of Conſcience,</hi> where
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56949:54"/>they may ſee how they impoſe upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others, by obtruding upon them <hi>Private Opinion</hi> or <hi>perſwaſion</hi> for <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> for unleſs they be certain by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation</hi> of clear <hi>Scripture,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of <hi>Scripture</hi> which will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a Doubt, that the things impoſed are Unlawful; <hi>Conſcience</hi> is not concerned in them, and it is only their <hi>Opinion,</hi> which ought to ſubmit to <hi>Publique Peace,</hi> and Government, which are clear and evident Commands of <hi>God.</hi> If the things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded are Unlawful, ſhew us the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition: If they be not Unlawful, they may be impoſed; for any man may by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> be lawfully commanded to do what is <hi>Lawful,</hi> for the obtaining <hi>Peace</hi> and Happineſs to himſelf and all others of the ſame <hi>Society;</hi> Nay he is bound in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> to do it.</p>
               <p>BUT for a further ſatisfaction, and a ſhort Anſwer, I deſire it may be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that every ſubmiſſion to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice of another who is of a different <hi>Opinion,</hi> is not an <hi>Error,</hi> if the thing be indifferent about which we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree; and that I may without offending my <hi>Conſcience,</hi> do what I am commanded, though in my private Judgment I do not approve of it, if by doing of it I promote <hi>Peace,</hi> and ſhew my Obedience: For where the <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, whether by not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56949:54"/>this, I ſhall obey my own <hi>Judgment,</hi> which doubts whether I may do it Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; or diſobey that <hi>Power</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me to do it, which I cannot deny but has a Lawful power to command me? The Reſolution is eaſy; for I am not by my obedience to a <hi>private</hi> doubt, to break a known <hi>Command of God,</hi> who commands Obedience to my Superiors in all things which are not contrary to his <hi>commands;</hi> and whether we ſhould obey <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man,</hi> our ſelves or the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and Rulers of of the Church, is no ſuch hard <hi>Queſtion</hi> as ſome <hi>people</hi> have made it.</p>
               <p>BESIDES, Though wilful Errors in <hi>Faith</hi> are Damnable, yet <hi>Errors</hi> in Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces neither are nor can be ſo, unleſs we make them ſo our ſelves by Diſobedience to <hi>God,</hi> in refuſing for <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>

                  <hi>Mankind.</hi> For whether I ſhould pray in a <hi>Surplice,</hi> or in a <hi>Cloak,</hi> is not a point of <hi>Salvation;</hi> for I may do it with either, or neither, and yet go to Heaven; but Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to my Lawful Superiors, ſhould they command me to pray to <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> in either of them, is an <hi>Error</hi> in <hi>Faith;</hi> for who ever is guilty of that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, muſt either believe that <hi>God</hi> is not the <hi>Author</hi> of that Command, or that it is not true, which is <hi>Infidelity and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</hi> Now let any perſon of Sobriety <hi>Judg</hi> whether ſuch a <hi>Conſcience</hi> is a good <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and void of offence to <hi>God</hi> and Men, which will ſtrain at the <hi>Gnat</hi> of an indifferent <hi>Ceremony,</hi> and ſwallow the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel</hi> of Diſobedience?

               </p>
               <p>I deſire to make this as clear as I can; and therefore we will Inſtance in the <hi>ſign of the Croſs after Baptiſm;</hi> This <hi>Ceremony</hi> is by many ſo much abhorred, that they will rather not have their <hi>Children</hi> received into

               <p>BUT ſuppoſing that there were a real <hi>Clog</hi> of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> (which none can juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complain of amongſt us) yet would any man looſe the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> for fear of the <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi> refuſe to Eat good and wholſome <hi>Diet,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Diſh</hi> was Silver, and too much <hi>Garniſhed;</hi> and by <hi>Schiſm</hi> and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience run the hazard of his own <hi>Soul,</hi> and all thoſe ſeduced by him, meerly to avoid the doing of thoſe things, which if he does them cannot in the leaſt <hi>prejudice</hi> his <hi>Salvation?</hi> for theſe are only the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> of our maintaining <hi>Peace, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> but not the <hi>Conditions</hi> upon which our Salvation depends; becauſe <hi>God</hi> has no where ſaid, he that does theſe things ſhall be <hi>damned,</hi> and he that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains from them ſhall be <hi>ſaved;</hi> but he has ſaid, we muſt hear the <hi>Church,</hi> and if ſhe Commands this, for <hi>Peace</hi> ſake, we muſt Obey, leſt we be juſtly eſteemed as <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and Heathens.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>THIRDLY, It will be objected, That by this <hi>Rule,</hi> all the <hi>Gallicane, German,</hi> and other <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches, who live under a Government which owns and Commands the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Diſcipline and Church, will hereby be made <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> to thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>National</hi> Churches, of which they are Members; and that hereby a neceſſity is laid upon us to return to the Obedience of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for if thoſe Churches may diſſent from their <hi>National</hi> Churches, and yet hold the true <hi>Faith,</hi> why may not we; why ſhould their Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be Lawful, and ours Damnable?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer Firſt, That the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between thoſe Churches, and the <hi>National Church</hi> in which they are, does not conſiſt in Matters of <hi>Circumſtance</hi> or <hi>Ceremony</hi> but in Matters of <hi>Faith;</hi> and though I will neither undertake the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of thoſe <hi>Churches</hi> either in Doctrine or <hi>Diſcipline;</hi> yet, I ſuppoſe, they ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the <hi>Roman Communion</hi> upon the account of the Impoſitions of that Church in Points of <hi>Faith,</hi> ſuch as are the <hi>Popes Supremacy</hi> (never owned in <hi>France</hi> even by the <hi>Catholiques</hi>) the Doctrines of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi> the <hi>real Preſence</hi> by <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1.</note> And would the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church Impoſe no more upon Chriſtians as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation, than is contained in thoſe three famous <hi>Creeds</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles, Nice,</hi> and St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and what is clearly contained in <hi>Scripture,</hi> which have ever been the <hi>Standards</hi> of the <hi>Catholique Faith,</hi> I think every good Chriſtian, over whom they may challenge a Lawful <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> ought to joyn with them in Communion of Government; and even thoſe over whom they can rightly challenge none, ought yet to agree with them in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Faith;</hi> Nay, ſhould they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand many <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in the Service of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56949:58"/>God, more than they do, yet thoſe who live in the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of that Church, ought to ſubmit to them for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Unity, Peace, and Charity: and I doubt not but the Foreign <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (at leaſt in Charity I hope ſo) if there were no other matters of Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, would eaſily be perſwaded to ſubmit to all the Points of Government, Ceremony, and much more. I remember what a Famous <hi>French Miniſter</hi> ſaid to this Purpoſe, when he was told that ſome of the <hi>Engliſh Nonconformiſts</hi> refuſed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were Enjoyned to wear the <hi>Surplice,</hi> and other Veſtments; <hi>I wiſh,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that the King of</hi> France <hi>would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me to perform my Function in a Fools Coat:</hi> ſo little did he think the outſide and dreſs of <hi>Religion</hi> to be of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of it, and ſo neceſſary did he <hi>judge</hi> Obedience, as well as true Faith, to the Peace, Unity and Happineſs of the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT Secondly, Many of thoſe <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> have Licence and <hi>Tolleration</hi> given them, to Celebrate the Worſhip and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>God</hi> according to their own <hi>Way,</hi> and by that Diſpenſation, they are free from the guilt of Diſobedience to the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrate;</hi> and for the Obedience they owe to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I preſume they are willing to give it with all their
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56949:59"/>hearts, if <hi>Rome</hi> Exacted no more in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Faith</hi> than <hi>God Almighty</hi> requires as neceſſary to <hi>Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT the <hi>Caſe</hi> is clearly different betwixt our Diſſenters, and the Foreign <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> for our Differences are, or at leaſt are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be, about matters of <hi>Polity,</hi> and the Manner of performance of the Offices of <hi>Religion:</hi> and let the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> prove us but <hi>Guilty</hi> of deſtroying one <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith,</hi> or impoſing any thing to be believed or done contrary to the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and let them diſſent from us in <hi>Gods Name;</hi> and till they can do that, their <hi>Separation</hi> will be a horrid <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and their <hi>Nonconformity</hi> a manifeſt Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Laws of <hi>God</hi> and Men. And ſhould the <hi>Foreign</hi> Churches refuſe the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey the <hi>Princes</hi> whoſe Subjects they are, commanding them, if there were no greater Differences than Matters of <hi>Ceremony</hi> and Circumſtance, I doubt not but their <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> and Diſobedience would deſerve the ſame <hi>Character.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT ſuppoſing the Supreme <hi>Power</hi> of thoſe Countries ſhould abſolutely prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> the exerciſe of their <hi>Religion,</hi> I think they ought to obey, and fall to the <hi>Old</hi> Arms of the <hi>Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Prayers and Tears,</hi> and not to the new <hi>Methods,</hi> of <hi>Manaces,</hi> making <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>THIS was the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> of the <hi>Ancient</hi> Chriſtians, who Conquered more by the <hi>Croſs,</hi> than the Perſecutors by all their <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty;</hi> who overcame by Suffering, and not by <hi>Rebelling.</hi> A remarkable <hi>Inſtance</hi> of which. we have in the Army of <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> who were obedient to him as their Temporal <hi>Soveraign</hi> ſo long as he liv'd; but after he had <hi>jeſted</hi> out his <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious</hi> Soul with a <hi>Viciſtî Galilaee,</hi> and that <hi>Jovinianus</hi> was choſen <hi>Emperor,</hi> which he refuſed as being a Chriſtian, and thinking the whole Army <hi>Pagans,</hi> they all cried out, <hi>Et nos ſumus Chriſtiani,</hi> We are all of us alſo <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Here were men in <hi>Arms,</hi> a Powerful Number of <hi>Veterane</hi> and Victorious <hi>Legions;</hi> and yet had they not ſo much as a Rebellious thought of Eſtabliſhing <hi>Religion</hi> by force or <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> in Government as well as Faith, is the Bond of Peace; and Obedience a Duty therefore which all men owe to their Lawful Superiors, as the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Ligature of a <hi>National Church;</hi> which being a <hi>Political Society</hi> of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men, does therefore require a <hi>Political</hi> Government in <hi>Religious</hi> as well as <hi>Civil</hi> affairs.</p>
               <p>THE not well conſidering of this Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between a <hi>National</hi> and the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church,</hi> ſeems to be the chief Ground of the <hi>Quarrels</hi> among Chriſtians: for the Catholique Church being the Spiritual <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt,</hi> is United in it ſelf and to him by the Spiritual <hi>Bond</hi> of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Faith;</hi> which <hi>Faith</hi> may be kept Whole and Undefiled, though there be great Differences in <hi>External Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> For all <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are not fit for all <hi>Places;</hi> as for Example, <hi>Submerg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the perſon <hi>Baptized</hi> may do very

               <p>NOR do we ever find the <hi>Primitive</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſtianity oppoſing any humane

               <p>THIS being therefore granted, That our Obedience to the Laws of the <hi>Polity</hi> or <hi>Nation</hi> wherein we live, (ſo long as they command nothing contrary to the <hi>Divine Law</hi>) is a part of our Chriſtian <hi>Religion,</hi> (as may be eaſily made appear from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Scripture, and the Practice of the beſt and pureſt Ages of <hi>Primitive</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity) even in ſuch Conſtitutions as concern the Government of the Church, as well as the Temporal Affairs of State, which was done with great happineſs to both, in the Reigns of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, and many other Chriſtian <hi>Emperors;</hi> I

               <p>THIS Neceſſity is grounded both in the Prudence of the Lawful <hi>Policy,</hi> and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> I will begin with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious <hi>Neceſſity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE muſt therefore conſider the <hi>Eſſence,</hi> the <hi>Nature,</hi> the Deſign, and the Intention of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> in that part of it which differences it from all other <hi>Religions,</hi> both <hi>Pagan, Jewiſh,</hi> and <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of that muſt be our Great Deſign, if we will be true Followers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not in Words profeſs we own him, but in <hi>Actions</hi> deny him, and his <hi>Royal Prieſthood</hi> over us.</p>
               <p>NOW the very <hi>Eſſence</hi> of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion conſiſts in Love, or <hi>Charity;</hi> this is the <hi>New</hi> Commandment, and the fulfilling of the <hi>Old:</hi> and herein it is that Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity differs from and Excells all other <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions.</hi> The <hi>Heathens</hi> knew no more of this than their <hi>Intereſt</hi> obliged them to; and therefore all thoſe of Different <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> Manners, or Religions, were eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Barbarians</hi> and Enemies; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly treated: and had not <hi>God Almighty</hi> permitted the <hi>Regiment</hi> of the World to be

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56949:64"/>ſcarce any thing elſe but a repetition of that Command, and the reaſons for it: which brings into mind what I have ſomewhere read of that <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> that in his extreme old age reſiding at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and governing the Churches of the leſſer <hi>Aſia;</hi> when he was not able to perform the <hi>Offices</hi> of the Church, yet he would be carried in his chair to the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of Chriſtians, where he would ſeveral times repeat this Sentence; <hi>My little Children love one another:</hi> and being demanded the reaſon of this ſhort, but Excellent <hi>Sermon,</hi> he made anſwer to this Effect, becauſe, <hi>It did compriſe the ſum of all Religion, and that Charity would cover a multitude of other faults.</hi> And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> doubts not to give it the <hi>preheminence</hi> above the two other principal <hi>Graces.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Now</hi> (ſays he) <hi>abideth Faith, Hope, and Charity, but the greateſt of theſe is Charity.</hi> For when <hi>Hope</hi> ſhall be compleated by <hi>poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> changed into <hi>Fruition,</hi> then ſhall <hi>Charity</hi> be moſt triumphant, as being the Life of Heaven, and the pleaſing imployment of a glorious <hi>Eternity.</hi> And certainly it is this love unſeigned both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>God</hi> and towards our <hi>Brethren,</hi> that is ſo of the Eſſence of <hi>Religion,</hi> that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out both theſe, it is but a meer <hi>Impoſtor:</hi> for no perſon can truely fear <hi>God,</hi> who does not ſmcerely love him; and no man loves

               </p>
               <p>NOW taking this for a <hi>Foundation,</hi> which no good Chriſtian can deny, I proceed to ſhew that it is abſolutely impoſſible to maintain this <hi>Charity</hi> without <hi>

               <p>THUS we ſee that Unity in Point of Government, as well as Faith, is abſolutely neceſſary in a National Church to preſerve it in <hi>Peace</hi> and Charity, and that is in plain Terms to render it truly Chriſtian, and a part of the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> which we all profeſs to believe as an <hi>Article</hi> of our Faith. We ſhall ſee in the next place how neceſſary this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> in point of Government, is to maintain <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Diſcipline</hi> in the <hi>World;</hi> and how without it, that great <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Keys</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave to his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and their Succeſſors, for the Government of his <hi>Church,</hi> becomes impracticable, and of no Uſe or Authority for ſuppreſſing <hi>Vice,</hi> or Encouraging true <hi>Piety</hi> and Religion.</p>
               <p>LOUD and clamorous are the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and Declamations againſt the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs and <hi>Debauchery</hi> of the preſent <hi>Age;</hi> and not without too evident Truth and Reaſon: <hi>Impiety</hi> which was formerly uſed to wait for the twilight, dare now walk bare fac't, and ſtare upon the <hi>Sun:</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of the modeſt <hi>Debauchees</hi> of his <hi>Age, They that are drunken are drunken
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56949:73"/>in the Night;</hi> but now licentious men are become ſo impudent as to ſcorn to throw the <hi>Mantle</hi> of Darkneſs over their vitious <hi>Intemperance,</hi> that they take a Pleaſure and a <hi>Pride</hi> to Riot in the day time, and to affront <hi>God</hi> and Men, and even <hi>humane Nature</hi> it ſelf, by their prodigious and <hi>Publique</hi> Sins and Follies.

               <p>ALL this is laid upon the Government of the <hi>Church,</hi> which though it be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent as the light by which they are bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acted; yet muſt they conſpire in the guilt of theſe horrid <hi>Crimes,</hi> if we will believe <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> who bluſh not to lay this falſe Accuſation to the Charge of the Government, that thereby they may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it Criminal and <hi>Odious,</hi> and themſelves and Party Clear and <hi>Innocent;</hi> when as in truth and reality, the <hi>Guilt</hi> of theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages will be found to lie at their own <hi>Doors;</hi> and let them wipe their mouths never ſo demurely, and ſay they have done no Evil,<note place="margin">

I will indeavour it; and yet with all the Chriſtian Compaſſion that I am capable of; for I have no deſign to Expoſe their <hi>Perſons</hi> to hatred, but to bring them to true Repentance, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the Danger of thoſe <hi>Ways,</hi> which with the ſpecious ſhew of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and Holineſs, deceive them into a <hi>Contempt</hi> of the terrible Authority of the Church, and others, by their <hi>Example,</hi> into all Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, and <hi>Impiety.</hi>

               <p>THAT <hi>Chriſt</hi> left to the Governors of his Church the Power of the <hi>Keys,</hi> is moſt Evident from his own plain and clear Words. For when he was to leave this World, he called his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to him, and <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus unto them again,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>THIS Power of the <hi>Keys,</hi> of binding and looſing, is the Power of <hi>Excommunication</hi> of Offenders, and Abſolution of <hi>Penitents,</hi> and is indeed all the <hi>Power</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> left with his Church, and the only <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> which the Governors can exerciſe

               </p>
               <p>AN Inſtance of this terrible Sentence of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> we have inflicted upon the <hi>Inceſtuous Corinthian;</hi> and that with a great <hi>Formality:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5.</note> 
                  <hi>This is my Determination</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>) <hi>In the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when yeare gathered together, and my Spirit with the power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to deliver ſuch a one to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;</hi> as he tells us in another place, that <hi>he had delivered Hymeneus and Alexander to Satan, that they might learn not to Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By virtue of this dreadful Power it was, that the <hi>Primitive</hi> Governors of the Church, even when they had no aſſiſtance, but all oppoſition from the <hi>Secular Powers,</hi> yet kept the Flock of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in all Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Subjection, good Order and <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline:</hi> Then were <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Miracles of Charity, <hi>Piety,</hi> and Devotion, to the wondring <hi>Pagans,</hi> when they were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thoſe Duties by no <hi>Humane</hi> Laws,

               <p>NOR were they more fearful of this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Sentence of <hi>Excommunication,</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:56949:76"/>than deſirous of the <hi>Abſolution</hi> of the Church, to reſtore them to the Honour of <hi>God Almighty</hi> after they had offended; and by ſerious and Solemn <hi>Repentance,</hi> were thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>FIRST, Men avoided the Danger of flattering themſelves into a dangerous <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion</hi> of the Goodneſs and ſafety of their <hi>Condition;</hi> and by conſequence from that ſecurity and falſe <hi>Peace</hi> which has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed <hi>Millions</hi> into <hi>Eternal</hi> Miſery: For as nothing is more natural than for men to love themſelves, ſo nothing does more
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56949:76"/>powerfully incline them to <hi>Judge</hi> favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and with a dangerous <hi>Partiality</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their <hi>Eternal</hi> Condition; it being with <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> of the Soul as with thoſe of the Body, where no Perſons, not even the Learned in the Art of <hi>Hermes,</hi> when ſick themſelves, are more incompetent <hi>Judges</hi> of their own ſtate, than thoſe who labour under it; who many times <hi>Flatter</hi> themſelves with <hi>delirous</hi> Fancies of Life and Health, even when they are under the <hi>Agonies</hi> of approaching <hi>Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SECONDLY, Hereby many haynous ſins which men commit in ſecret, were nipt in the <hi>Bloſſom;</hi> and believing that without <hi>Confeſſion</hi> there was no <hi>Abſolution</hi> to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, the very fear of Diſcovery, or of <hi>Damnation</hi> without it, gave ſtrange checks to ſuch <hi>Tempers</hi> who had not abandoned all <hi>Modeſty:</hi> Nor is it to be eſteemed a <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> that Men ſhould receive a more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful <hi>Control</hi> from the fear of Humane Knowledg, than from the apprehenſions of the <hi>Omniſcient Divinity,</hi> ſince it is ſo well known, that all men are more affected by the power of ſenſible Objects, than of <hi>Faith</hi> and Reaſon; and every mans own experience will convince him that the fear of Shame and Reproach upon <hi>Diſcovery,</hi> has at leaſt in ſome part of his Life been more powerful to preſerve him from ſome <hi>Sins,</hi> than all the terrors of a <hi>Future</hi> ſtate
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56949:77"/>of Miſery; and the witneſs of a little Child which might make a Diſcovery to the <hi>World,</hi> has prevented the <hi>Execution</hi> of ſome wicked Deſigns, which the <hi>Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations</hi> of the <hi>Divine</hi> preſence in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, would have had no great influence upon.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, Hereby <hi>People</hi> came to have a true Love and Veneration for their <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Guides,</hi> a love of Reverence, and a love of Tenderneſs; looking upon them as their Spiritual <hi>Fathers,</hi> and honouring them as ſuch: Then men did not ſet an Eſtimate upon them, only proportionate to their abilities of making <hi>Extempore Prayers</hi> (a thing wholly unknown to the firſt <hi>Ages</hi> of Chriſtianity) or for their gifts of <hi>Eloquent Orations</hi> in the Pulpit; no more than they would do their Phyſicians for thoſe <hi>Talents;</hi> which though very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent accompliſhments, yet were not thought <hi>Eſſential</hi> to their Profeſſion, nor conducive to the Health of their <hi>Patients;</hi> who are not to be diſcourſed or courted by the power of <hi>Rhethorique</hi> into recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but they look't upon them as thoſe who had the charge of their Souls, and that they were ſet by God <hi>to watch over them,</hi>

                  <hi>as they that muſt give an account;</hi> and for this Reaſon it was that they obeyed thoſe that had the Rule over them, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:56949:77"/>
               <p>THEN was there no quarrelling, no <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigious</hi> Suits at Law about the Maintenance of the <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> (one thing, and the main one, which renders the preſent <hi>Clergy</hi> ſo ſlenderly poſſeſſed of the affections of the <hi>People</hi>) but they thought with the good <hi>Apoſtle, That thoſe who ſowed unto them Spiritual things, ought to reap a ſhare of their Carnal things:</hi> and after the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the <hi>Clergy</hi> was Eſtabliſhed by the <hi>Donatives</hi> of their Pious Anceſtors, who gave thoſe Revenues as <hi>Free Alms</hi> to God Almighty,<note place="margin">Frank Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moigne Libera &amp; perpetua Eleemoſyna, The Tenure of the Church.</note> and for the ſupport of his Servants and Service; they thought it no leſs than <hi>Sacriledge to rob God of Tithes and Offerings,</hi> dedicated to the Uſe of thoſe who by their Attendance upon his <hi>Altar,</hi> were incapacitated to amaſs up Riches, or even <hi>Competencies</hi> for a future ſubſiſtence, as the <hi>Secular</hi> People were by ſeveral Arts and Trades.

               <p>I am not ignorant that this will expoſe me to ſome <hi>Obloquy,</hi> and that I ſhall be Cenſured hereby to aim at an Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>FOR the Firſt, I can make no other <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi> of my Innocence, but an unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Proteſtation</hi> with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt of my Underſtanding, <hi>I ſpeak the truth in Chriſt,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>SECONDLY, Hereby men come to have a mean and contemptible Opinion of this Power of the <hi>Church:</hi> And value <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> from any Church, no more than ſome idle Servants do to be turned out of their <hi>Maſters</hi> Doors, who will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently tell you, that the <hi>World</hi> is wide enough, and if one will not, another will. That there are more Services to be had: So will this ſort of <hi>People</hi> tell you, there are more Churches; and no queſtion but where in any <hi>Nation</hi> this Principle is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there would be almoſt as many Churches as <hi>People;</hi> and when once they
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56949:84"/>are come to ſlight the <hi>Cenſure</hi> and the Church, they will never ſo much as think of being releaſed from the Dangerous Bond of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> or to have their Sins remitted upon Earth, by the power of that Church which they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, Hereby others of the moſt <hi>Looſe</hi> and Licencious Lives will be incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to continue impious and Irreligious, though owning no <hi>Sect</hi> or <hi>Faction:</hi> And coming by their <hi>Example</hi> to deſpiſe this Power of the true Church, and to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Excommunication</hi> as a thing of no Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they will value no Church; but aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don themſelves to all manner of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Irreligion and <hi>Atheiſm;</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they can but ſcape the danger of <hi>Humane Laws,</hi> they will never trouble themſelves about the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FOURTHLY, People will in a little time come to believe, that the only Duty of the <hi>Miniſter</hi> conſiſts in their abilities to Preach and Exhort; and that to Admoniſh and Correct is no part of their <hi>Office;</hi> and this being ſo eaſie a thing to be attain'd, and many times <hi>Eloquence</hi> (as before was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) being a Natural <hi>Talent;</hi> Hereby Bold, Illiterate, Unexamined, Unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, Conceited, and <hi>Pragmatical Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atres,</hi> will invade the <hi>Sacred Function;</hi> by which means <hi>Errors</hi> will abound, new
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56949:85"/>
                  <hi>Hereſies</hi> will ſpring up daily, and old ones revive, flouriſh, and increaſe without control or contradiction; the <hi>Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> will be either neglected and laid aſide; or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned</hi> by unhallowed hands: and in ſhort, thoſe great <hi>Miſchiefs,</hi> which are ſo much feared, muſt break in upon us; either <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm,</hi> or ſuperſtitious <hi>will Worſhip,</hi> the Commandments and <hi>Traditions</hi> of Wilful, Ignorant, and <hi>Erroneous</hi> Men; and when once the Church is trampled under foot by ſo many Sects, and <hi>Hereſies,</hi> Ignorance will daily get ground, and that ſets the Dore wide open, either to the dreaded thing call'd <hi>Popery,</hi> to <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> or the <hi>Turkiſh Alchoran,</hi> which comes with the faireſt Pretence, and the fineſt Dreſs to win their Favour.</p>
               <p>I do heartily wiſh all this were ſpoken like the Prophecy of <hi>Jonah</hi> againſt the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivites;</hi> what was ſuch occaſion of grief and diſcontent to him, as to oblige him in a ſullen humor to wiſh to dye, would be to me the greateſt <hi>Joy</hi> of my Life: But <hi>Experience,</hi> that fatal <hi>Miſtreſs,</hi> has taught us the truth of ſome of theſe Effects, and may well give us terrible apprehenſions of what we may expect. For no ſooner can an <hi>Offender</hi> fall under the deſerved <hi>Cenſure</hi> of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> or but in the danger of it, but preſently he turns <hi>Diſſenter,</hi> is
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56949:85"/>received into the boſom of ſome <hi>Sect</hi> or <hi>Faction,</hi> and then he bids <hi>Defiance</hi> to all the Power of the Church, and fears no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Secular Writ <hi>de Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato Capiendo.</hi> Nay, I have my ſelf heard ſome Perſons boaſt of their being <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,</hi> and pretend to receive it as a ſavour, to be prohibited coming into the Church: from theſe mens contempt and vilifying of this dreadful <hi>Sentence,</hi> others who have no <hi>Religion</hi> have learned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe it too; nor is there any thing in it formidable to them, beſides the expence of their <hi>Money</hi> to the <hi>Lay-Officers</hi> of the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Courts:</hi> and when once men come to place all their Religion in fear of the Secular Power, and have no other bridle upon their unruly Paſſions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, beſides the <hi>Reins</hi> of Humane Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments and the Laws of the <hi>Civil</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, it is not to be admired if they run headlong into <hi>Brutiſh</hi> Impiety and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>Atheiſm:</hi> and they who are taught to believe, (and eaſily learn the Leſſon both by <hi>Example</hi> and Precept) that the <hi>Prieſt</hi> or <hi>Biſhop</hi> has no more Power over their <hi>Souls,</hi> than over their <hi>Bodies,</hi> will not be long before they Deſpiſe both the <hi>Perſons</hi> and their <hi>Office;</hi> and when men are arrived at that, for my part, I look upon their condition to be next to <hi>Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate:</hi> for however they may pleaſe and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56949:86"/>flatter themſelves in their <hi>Gay</hi> and <hi>Jolly</hi> humor of deſpiſing theſe contemptible <hi>Prieſts,</hi> the affront is really done to <hi>God Almighty,</hi> and I cannot ſee any great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in ſuch <hi>Atheiſtical Drollery.</hi> Hear ye Deſpiſers, and Tremble at what our Great <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour</hi> ſays concerning the 70 <hi>Diſciples</hi> whom he ſent abroad to Preach the <hi>Goſpel of the Kingdom.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>THE Root of all our <hi>Miſeries, Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>Diſorders</hi> is, That men take this for a <hi>Principle, That they may be Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to Lawful Authority without danger of Damnation:</hi> and ſo far has the miſchief of this fretting <hi>Gangrene</hi> ſpread it ſelf, that many <hi>People</hi> eſteem it a part of their <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> to diſobey the <hi>Civil Power,</hi> and think it is impoſſible for them to be ſaved, ſhould they be obedient to its Commands; which they think are inconſiſtent with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of <hi>God.</hi> This <hi>Error</hi> muſt proceed either from <hi>Malice,</hi> or <hi>Miſtake;</hi> I will be

               <p>THE great Deſign of the infinitely glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, good and Wiſe <hi>Creator,</hi> being the Happineſs of Mankind, he therefore proportioned a <hi>Method</hi> for the obtaining of it; and Man being <hi>Created</hi> with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Capacity</hi> of Injoying Happineſs both here and hereafter, therefore did that, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Wiſdom</hi> appoint <hi>Religion</hi> as the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> for attaining both; and for the accompliſhment of thoſe <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>Excellent Ends,</hi> it is furniſhed with <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Precepts,</hi> which bear a double <hi>Reſpect</hi> to this double <hi>Capacity;</hi> one part Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts us to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>future</hi> Happineſs in the <hi>External</hi> fruition of his grorious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in Heaven; and the other Leads us to the Happineſs of this Mortal State, by the <hi>Politicl Rules</hi> of Living Well, with a mutual reſpect, not only to our own, but the happineſs of one another, by the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and moderate Uſe and Enjoyment of the inferior <hi>Creation,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> therefore made, <hi>that he might ſhew his Glory, his Wiſdom, his Power, and his Goodneſs to the Sons of Men.</hi> So that the ſum of all <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>

                  <hi>though it makes them tremble.</hi> To believe aright, we muſt refer our ſelves to thoſe <hi>Divine Truths</hi> which God has from Heaven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us concerning himſelf and our Duty, the ſhort ſums of which <hi>Faith</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> has collected out of the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, in the three Famous <hi>Creeds</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Nice.</hi> To Live well, it is required, that a man ſubmits to all thoſe practical <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> and Rules of Life which <hi>God</hi> has commanded in his <hi>Will,</hi> revealed in his holy Word, by <hi>Juſtice, Temperance, Prudence, Chaſtity, Obedience, &amp;c.</hi> and for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of Happineſs by theſe <hi>Rules,</hi> in this preſent Life, <hi>God</hi> has not left Men in a wild parity like <hi>Brutes,</hi> but has by the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of his <hi>Providence,</hi> divided the <hi>World</hi> into ſuperior, and inferior Degrees of Men, Subjects and Soveraigns, intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one to Rule and Govern, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the other to Obey; and for this he has left many <hi>Poſitive</hi> Commands, too well known, and too numerous to be here repeated.</p>

               <p>FIRST, Becauſe <hi>Order</hi> is abſolutely Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as well in the <hi>Church</hi> as in the <hi>State,</hi> and is Poſitively commanded by <hi>God; Let every thing be done Decently and in Order,</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>as in all the Churches of the Saints.</hi> Confuſion is abſolutely unlawful, <hi>God</hi> diſowns it: <hi>Peace</hi> is abſolutely Neceſſary in all Churches of <hi>Saints;</hi> without <hi>Order</hi> there can be no <hi>Peace,</hi> nor indeed any thing but <hi>Confuſion;</hi> without Governors, to appoint, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine Differences ariſing about <hi>Modes</hi> and Matters of Decency, there can be no <hi>Peace,</hi> becauſe Differences muſt be endleſs, and without <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to theſe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and their final <hi>Determinations,</hi> both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> they are no longer Rulers and Governours; but the <hi>Order</hi> which <hi>God</hi> has appointed in the <hi>World,</hi> to procure Peace and Happineſs, is utterly Subverted and Overthrown: For Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Obedience do mutually ſuppoſe each other; and as <hi>Logicians</hi> ſay, <hi>Pater eſt filii Pater,</hi> a Father is therefore a Father becauſe he has a Child, ſo a Governor, a <hi>King,</hi> a Magiſtrate in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> is therefore ſuch, becauſe he has People ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and obedient to him; and as all the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56949:92"/>Power of Governors is limited to thoſe things which are left undetermined by <hi>Gods Poſitive Laws,</hi> ſo all the Obedience of Subjects is confined to their Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in thoſe particulars which <hi>God</hi> has left wholy in the Power of our <hi>Superiors:</hi> and who ever reſiſts, or refuſes to Obey, <hi>ſhall therefore receive Damnation,</hi> becauſe he deſtroys the very <hi>Eſſence</hi> and End of Government; and in ſaying, <hi>We will not have this man Raign over us,</hi> acts directly contrary to the Will of <hi>God,</hi> who ſays he ſhall, and that we muſt <hi>Obey</hi> him, in order to the <hi>Peace</hi> and Happineſs of the <hi>World,</hi> the due Adminiſtration of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Virtue, and Practice of <hi>Religion,</hi> by leading quiet Lives under our <hi>Superiors,</hi> in all Godlineſs and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty; by which Method we can only hope to arrive at Eternal Happineſs in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT Secondly, Becauſe all <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Laws</hi> which concern the <hi>Order</hi> and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the <hi>Church,</hi> are of a mixt <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Political</hi> as well as <hi>Religious;</hi> and ſo are all Humane and <hi>Civil Laws</hi> too; and therefore there is the ſame reaſon for Obedience to the one as to the other: and they do both equally bind the <hi>Conſcience</hi> to <hi>Obedience:</hi> The ſame <hi>Power</hi> makes the one, as makes the other; the ſame <hi>Reaſon</hi> is the Foundation of the one, as of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56949:92"/>they are addreſſed to the ſame End; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Peace,</hi> Happineſs, and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>People,</hi> and therefore there is the ſame obligation to Obedience for the one as the other; and all Men are bound in <hi>Conſcience,</hi> as Members of a <hi>Society,</hi> to promote the Peace, and welfare of that <hi>Society;</hi> which is not to be obtained any other Way, but by obeying the Command of <hi>God,</hi> in being ſubject to the <hi>Government</hi> of that <hi>Society</hi> of which we are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.

                  <hi>Seek the Peace of the City whither I have cauſed you to be carried away Captives, and pray unto the Lord for it; for in the Peace thereof ye ſhall have Peace.</hi> So that if <hi>Peace</hi> and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be the End of <hi>Society,</hi> all Men are bound to Pray for it, and promote it. If the End be Commanded by God, the Means to obtain that End muſt be Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and <hi>God</hi> having intruſted the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of Church and State with the Means and Way of procuring this Happineſs, their Choice of ſome, among all the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Expedients that may be offer'd, muſt determine their Subjects, and becomes the <hi>Rule</hi> of their Obedience, as well in <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical</hi> as <hi>Civil Affairs;</hi> for if it were poſſible to ſeparate theſe two, then ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might be ſaid; but the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>State</hi> depending upon the <hi>Peace</hi> of the

                  <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>vicê verſa,</hi> No man can true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaid to promote the one by deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other. And therefore all men who are obliged to indeavour to advance one, muſt do it by advancing <hi>both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make this clear, I will give an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate</hi> in the Church, in matters of Order and Government. <hi>David,</hi> a man after <hi>Gods</hi> own Heart, in the Worſhip of God, which was left Undetermined, he takes upon him to regulate the <hi>Church;</hi> he Orders the <hi>Levites</hi> to appoint Singers on Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Muſick,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.16.</note> 
                  <hi>and Pſalteries, and Harps, Cymbals, and ſounding by lifting up the Voice with joy.</hi> They never ſtood to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute with him, becauſe <hi>God</hi> had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, that therefore it was Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but becauſe <hi>God</hi> had not any where Prohibited it, and he was their <hi>King,</hi> and might Command what was for decency and order in the Service of <hi>God,</hi> therefore they ought to <hi>Obey;</hi> and immediately they appoint <hi>Heman, and Aſaph, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and ſeveral others for that Service. <hi>David,</hi> and, after his Example, others frame and compoſe <hi>Anthems, Pſalms</hi> of Praiſe and Thankſgiving, in ſet forms of Words to praiſe <hi>God, Becauſe he is gracious, and his Mercy endureth for ever.</hi> Do the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> now quarrel, becauſe they are not permitted to ſhew their <hi>Parts, Gifts,</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:56949:93"/>and <hi>Abilities,</hi> in making <hi>Extempore Hymns,</hi> or Prayers? No ſuch matter: but preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Obedience to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> they make uſe of thoſe preſcribed, which are contained in the Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh Church.</hi> This order was after continued by <hi>Solomon,</hi> and approved by <hi>God; For it came to paſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.13.</note> 
                  <hi>as the Trumpeters, and Singers were as one, to make one ſound to be heard, in praiſing and thanking the Lord; and when they lift up their Voice with the Trumpets and Cymbals, and Inſtruments of Muſick, and praiſed the Lord, ſaying, For he is good, for his Mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever, that the houſe was filled with a Cloud, even the Houſe of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the reſult of all is this, That the <hi>Supreme Power</hi> of a <hi>Nation,</hi> being of <hi>Gods</hi> appointment for the Ruling of the <hi>People</hi> in order to their Happineſs, and commanding nothing contrary to <hi>Faith</hi> or good Manners, or any thing Prohibited by <hi>God</hi> himſelf, ought to be obeyed by all their <hi>Subjects</hi> of what <hi>Degrees</hi> or <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> ſoever, in all their <hi>Laws, Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> and <hi>Civil,</hi> in order to good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Decency,</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> both in Church and State: and that ſince all theſe Commands of theirs are in Obedience to <hi>Gods</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and in proſecution of the great Deſign of Happineſs here, and <hi>Eternally,</hi> by promoting <hi>Peace, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and <hi>Concord,</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:56949:94"/>therefore no <hi>Perſon</hi> can reſiſt that Power by Diſobedience, but he reſiſts the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of <hi>God,</hi> and becomes a Tranſgreſſor to <hi>God</hi> as well as Man; and runs the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of <hi>Eternal Damnation,</hi> due to all thoſe <hi>who know not God, and obey not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LET <hi>Diſſenters</hi> therefore either prove, that the <hi>Supreme Powers</hi> are not <hi>Lawful,</hi> that their <hi>Authority</hi> does not Extend to the <hi>Political</hi> part of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Affairs, that they have nothing to do to determine Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, that the things commanded are contrary to <hi>Faith,</hi> and a holy <hi>Life,</hi> are not conducive to <hi>Peace, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and the happineſs of the <hi>Nation,</hi> or that they are any where in direct Words or evident Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence prohibited by <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Scripture;</hi> or otherways they will never be able to prove that they are bound in <hi>Conſcience</hi> to diſobey <hi>Authority.</hi> Let them not think to ſhelter themſelves under the vain refuge, that <hi>God</hi> is to be obeyed rather than Men. This is that which proves them Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, for they do not diſobey Men, but <hi>God,</hi> in diſobeying Lawful <hi>Authority,</hi> when commanding nothing contrary to the Commands of <hi>God.</hi> And whoever does ſo, is managed not by the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> but the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Intereſt, Prejudice,</hi> or <hi>Ambition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN ſhort, Is any <hi>Form</hi> of Government
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56949:94"/>Lawful or Neceſſary in the <hi>Church?</hi> that it is, they affirm, in deſiring to Eſtabliſh their own; is Obedience neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? they will tell you, it is; Let them therefore be their own <hi>Judges.</hi> For if Obedience to their Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be neceſſary to Salvation, it muſt be becauſe their <hi>Authority</hi> is Lawful, for that is the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Conſcience;</hi> and if the preſent <hi>Authority</hi> be <hi>Lawful,</hi> and theirs <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped,</hi> then is their Diſobedience Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and their Obſtinacy inexcuſable, by their own <hi>Judgment.</hi> And if we do not prove the preſent Government Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and of <hi>Gods</hi> appintment, both the <hi>Civil,</hi> and Eccleſiaſtical, <hi>Phillida ſolus habeto.</hi> And till they have proved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Lawful <hi>Powers,</hi> and the preſent <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> Unlawful, let them be obedient to its Decrees and Determinations, as thoſe Laws reſpect the good of the <hi>Civil</hi> Society, if they will not, as they reſpect the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</hi>

               <p>Now to the obtaining of any tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Degrees of this Happy <hi>State,</hi> as there is <hi>one God, one Faith, one Baptiſm,</hi> ſo it is
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56949:97"/>abſolutely Neceſſary, that in one <hi>Nation</hi> there be one Form of Government in the <hi>Church</hi> as well as <hi>State:</hi> And that if it be not poſſible that all <hi>People</hi> ſhould be of one Mind, as to matters of <hi>Opinion,</hi> yet that they ſhould be of one Mind as to <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> to Government in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> which is matter of <hi>Faith.</hi> And it is but highly Reaſonable, that private <hi>Opinion</hi> ſhould confine it ſelf to private Breaſts, its proper <hi>Sphere,</hi> and not be permitted to walk abroad to affront <hi>Authority</hi> and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique <hi>Peace,</hi> Intereſt and Happineſs of a whole <hi>Nation,</hi> no more than particular Gain is ſuffered to undo the Publick Stock.</p>
               <p>DIFFERENCE in <hi>Opinion</hi> may well be Tollerated, and indeed cannot be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but yet were men managed by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,</hi> though not <hi>Religion,</hi> there need be no Miſchief from it; But to publiſh <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Opinion</hi> for Publique and neceſſary Truth, and to endeavour to impoſe it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, and upon <hi>Authority</hi> it ſelf, is a practice of the moſt pernicious Uſurpation and Conſequence in any Government: For this Oppoſition of <hi>Opinions</hi> naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a Diſunion of Mind, abſolutely De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of Government, which is to Unite all the Members of a Society into one common <hi>Body,</hi> of which Unity is the <hi>Soul;</hi> and whatſoever be the Cauſe of this <hi>Diſunion,</hi> the Effect is always an Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56949:97"/>of Affections among thoſe who differ one from another: Now as there is nothing that makes ſo cloſe a <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> in the minds of Men, as their concurrence in the ſame thoughts, Judgment, and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about any Matters, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Religion;</hi> So there is nothing that makes ſo great and Irreconcilable Diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between <hi>People,</hi> as their being and owning themſelves of differing <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and Opinions. For <hi>Religion</hi> is like a Common <hi>Centre,</hi> in which all the Lines of mutual Kindneſs meet, and are United together in an indiviſible <hi>Point:</hi> And we do more paſſionately love thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble us in our thoughts, than in our outward <hi>Lineaments</hi> and Proportions; and have a natural <hi>Averſion</hi> for thoſe who are unlike us in our <hi>Thoughts:</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe this <hi>Diſcord</hi> robs us of the pleaſure of <hi>Life,</hi> which is <hi>Society;</hi> and where the entertainment conſiſts in mutual Jarrs, and endleſs Diſputings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Contradictions, of which all men are impatient, the Converſation muſt needs be <hi>diſagreeable;</hi> for who ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts another, ſuppoſes himſelf more <hi>wiſe,</hi> and the other fooliſh; and where the knowledg of theſe differences is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, even in their ſilent <hi>Interviews,</hi> it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats them of all the pleaſure of Converſe and <hi>Society,</hi> and makes men uneaſie in the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56949:98"/>very <hi>Company</hi> of thoſe who are neither beloved by them, nor love them; as all men believe of thoſe who oppoſe them, and differ from them in their <hi>Judgments.</hi> So that it is not to be expected they ſhould be ready to do thoſe good <hi>Offices</hi> one for another, in order to the Common Good of the <hi>Society;</hi> but rather all the Miſchiefs and <hi>Injuries</hi> which they can, as <hi>Enemies;</hi> as all eſteem thoſe who are not United to them by Love and Kindneſs; and how happy any <hi>Society</hi> is like to prove, that is thus disjoynted in it ſelf, is not difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.</p>
               <p>BUT theſe <hi>Animoſities</hi> are extreamly heightened, in regard there is always ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than bare <hi>Opinion</hi> in the <hi>Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and that it is impoſſible totally to ſeparate <hi>Intereſt</hi> from <hi>Religion,</hi> and that therefore no man can look upon another as directly invading the one, without <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliquely</hi> deſigning againſt the other; and what ever <hi>Paſſion</hi> men may have for their <hi>Religion,</hi> they are inſeparably married to their <hi>Intereſt;</hi> &amp; the thred of that is twiſted with the <hi>Stamina Vitae,</hi> being indeed eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Eſſential both to the being &amp; well-being of the <hi>Body:</hi> For it is not in <hi>Religion</hi> as it is in <hi>Philoſophical</hi> Conteſts, where how eager ſoever men may appear to defend a <hi>Paradox,</hi> yet they are not Solicitous whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be true or falſe; for what matters

               <p>BUT in the Quarrels of <hi>Religion,</hi> there is always a <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum;</hi> and Men ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect not without good Reaſon, that the difference of <hi>Opinion</hi> is but the Colour or Pretext, it is <hi>Intereſt</hi> that is the firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the Ultimate <hi>Deſign;</hi> and this prevents all hope of Reconciliation, till one party do either voluntarily or by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint relinquiſh their pretences to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Right; for he who will invade the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of what another enjoys, by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to be a <hi>Diſſeiſor,</hi> becomes an <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:</hi> And there are few who arrive to that height of ſelf-denial, to hate themſelves, that they may love their <hi>Enemies,</hi> or to expoſe themſelves to the Inconveniences of cold Nakedneſs and Hunger, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abhors, that they may feed and cloth their <hi>Enemies:</hi> nor does <hi>Charity</hi> command it; for though that Compaſſionate <hi>Grace</hi> look abroad for <hi>Objects</hi> of <hi>Pity,</hi> yet ſhe always begins her Work at home; nor is any man obliged to pray for, or love his Enemies, ſo as not <hi>to provide for his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now where there are ſeveral diſtinct <hi>Churches</hi> in the ſame <hi>Nation,</hi> there being both <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Maintenance</hi> annexed to the Office of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> they will neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily incroach one upon another; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what the one gains, the other muſt looſe, the contrariety of <hi>Intereſts</hi> will widen the Difference between them, even to the utmoſt Extremity of <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Animoſity:</hi> and whilſt every <hi>Church</hi> will labour to <hi>agrandize</hi> it ſelf both in <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> by leſſening the Eſteem, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Power, and Revenues of the other, it will become a quarrel of <hi>Intereſt</hi> as well as <hi>Religion:</hi> and let any perſon, if he can, Juſtifie a <hi>Principle,</hi> that, by maintaining <hi>Domeſtique Quarrels,</hi> muſt be ruinous to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> and all the <hi>Peace</hi> and Happineſs of the preſent ſtate of Life, under the fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LET <hi>Diſſenters</hi> tell us what they pleaſe; and if their diſlike of the Government in the <hi>Church</hi> is purely upon the account of

                  <hi>Religion;</hi> former <hi>Experience</hi> has made the World ſufficiently ſenſible, that the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Power, and Revenues of the <hi>Church</hi> were the greateſt <hi>Crimes</hi> of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <p>AND as theſe <hi>Quarrels</hi> will be moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſo they will be Endleſs and <hi>Eternal:</hi> for admit once of many <hi>Forms</hi> of Church Government in the ſame <hi>Nation,</hi> and no ſooner ſhall one be uppermoſt, but the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> of the others, and their fear leſt they ſhould be cruſh't, or overſhadowed by it, will make all the leſſer <hi>Churches</hi> conſpire, for their common Security and <hi>Intereſt,</hi> to undermine and overthrow it.

               <p>THIS was the true ſtate of our Caſe in <hi>England,</hi> during our late Revolutions; the Church, and Religion were made to lead the Dance, but according to the <hi>Scotch Prophecy, The State of</hi> England <hi>Paid the Piper;</hi> for the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> in pretence <hi>Religious,</hi> but in reality <hi>Envious</hi> of the great Power, Honors, and Eſtates of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> never leſt till by <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Arms,</hi> perſwading the Credulous <hi>Vulgar,</hi> that it was <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> and animating their Party in their <hi>Rebellion,</hi> with promiſes of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Churches Revenue</hi> for a Booty; <hi>God Almighty</hi> was pleaſed, for our ſins, to permit them to be ſo ſucceſsful as to overthrow that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after it had ſtood above a thouſand years in <hi>England.</hi> No ſooner had <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> taken Poſſeſſion of <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vinyard, he being ſtoned and dead, but they became as Odious to the <hi>Independents,</hi> who with more cunning and Addreſs, and leſs trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, gently laid them aſide as <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> too; and notwithſtanding all their Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations from the <hi>Pulpit</hi> and the <hi>Preſs,</hi> both in their Prayers and Sermons, they could

His late Majeſty was a dreadful Example of this <hi>Truth;</hi> for did not all <hi>Europe</hi> ſtand gazing at our <hi>Flame,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever ſo much as offering their <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to Extinguiſh it? which of all his <hi>Confederates</hi> or <hi>Allies</hi> came in to his relief? did they not permit his <hi>Crown</hi> to be taken off his <hi>Head,</hi> and his <hi>Head</hi> from his <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> without any concern? although it was the Common Caſe of all <hi>Crowned Heads,</hi> and a Preſident which their <hi>Poſterity</hi> may have cauſe to repent that ever it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56949:109"/>but ſhall never able to raſe out of the <hi>Records</hi> of Time. And though this was a private and Inteſtine <hi>Quarrel;</hi> and therefore not eſteemed the concern of our <hi>Allies,</hi> yet does it manifeſtly prove, that ſince all <hi>Alliances</hi> are managed by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> if they come to believe, that to aſſiſt us againſt a Forrein <hi>Power,</hi> be as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle their Advantage, they will be as ſlow and backward to do it then: And there is nothing can more forceably perſwade them into ſuch a <hi>Belief,</hi> than by our own <hi>Diſunion</hi> and Diviſion, to put our ſelves out of a Capacity of being ſerviceable to their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> by the ability of mutual help and <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> in their time of Need.</p>
               <p>So that it muſt be pure Compaſſion for their own <hi>Affairs,</hi> and to keep the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance</hi> from inclining too much to one ſide, that muſt be the <hi>Motive</hi> to incourage them to lend us their hand; and ſince that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expected till they ſee us ready to <hi>Sink,</hi> let any perſon <hi>Judg</hi> into what a Miſerable Condition we muſt be reduced, before we receive that Help, or they come in to our <hi>Aid.</hi> Whereas, when any <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is powerful, by being <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nanimous,</hi> their <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Allies</hi> will upon the firſt Summons, be ready to aſſiſt them, not only for their own <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and becauſe they expect the like Kindneſs, upon the like <hi>Occaſions;</hi> but becauſe they will be
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56949:110"/>unwilling and afraid to diſoblige a <hi>Power,</hi> which but by withdrawing it ſelf from them, may expoſe them to Dangers and <hi>Hazards:</hi> Or reſenting it as an <hi>Injury</hi> and Affront, may at one time or another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it with thoughts of <hi>Revenge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that there is nothing can be more apparent than that <hi>Diſunion</hi> in any <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> weakens its Force and ſtrength at Home and Abroad, and expoſes it to the Danger of Foreign <hi>Enemies,</hi> whileſt it gives them all the Invitations and Aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they can deſire, to accompliſh their <hi>Conqueſt</hi> and its <hi>Ruine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT bedſies all this, there is ſomething more in this <hi>Diſunion</hi> in point of <hi>Church</hi> Government in our <hi>Nation,</hi> which is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly dangerous to the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And that is, that it Naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines all the ſeveral <hi>Parties</hi> to <hi>Antimonar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical</hi> Principles, and to entertain kind thoughts of <hi>Polyarchy</hi> in the State, as well as <hi>Anarchy</hi> in the Church; and of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to <hi>Democracy</hi> rather than <hi>Optimacy.</hi> For where the Government is Elective and Mutable, every ſeveral Party will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make ſuch an <hi>Intereſt</hi> in all ſuch <hi>Elections,</hi> as to have a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Governours, to be of their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion:</hi> By which <hi>Method</hi> they entertain a conſtant <hi>Hope</hi> that they ſhall be able, not only to continue that <hi>Liberty</hi> to their
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56949:110"/>
                  <hi>Way,</hi> but alſo to increaſe and Augment it. Nor is it poſſible by any Arguments to perſwade them that <hi>Monarchy</hi> is the beſt Form of Government; and which is ſtrange, the former experience of the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi> of the late <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> which was Eſtabliſhed upon the <hi>Ruines</hi> of our <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Proſperity,</hi> the toſſings, and Tumblings, the Uncertainties and Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of that raging Sea of <hi>Confuſion,</hi> is not convincing, but that they will Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque themſelves in it upon the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, although they know it is a <hi>Red-Sea</hi> of Blood, and leads us all to a <hi>Deſolate Wilderneſs.</hi> How contrary and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant this Government is to the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and Eſtabliſhed Laws of theſe <hi>Nations,</hi> I need not tell: But what muſt they be, who pretend for Religion to overthrow all the Foundations of the Earth, and put them out of Courſe, unleſs <hi>God</hi> hold up the <hi>Pillars</hi> of it, as hitherto he has done in deſpight of the raging of the <hi>People.</hi> However, it afords us a clear diſcovery of the Tempers of thoſe men who keep up theſe <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Diſunion,</hi> which have ſuch a deſperate influence upon the <hi>Civil</hi> Affairs, and endeavour to Ruine the <hi>State</hi> by ſetting up Religion; and whoſe reſtleſs and unwearied Induſtry leaves no ſtone unmoved; Nay, who will move Heaven and Earth, to accompliſh their Deſign.

               </p>
               <p>IT was the great Misfortune of the Poet <hi>Claudian,</hi> that his Excellent Wit fell upon dry and barren Subjects; the ſame ill Luck has this Writer, in falling upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> ſo contrary to his own, and the <hi>Judgment</hi> of his <hi>Church;</hi> that I ſhall uſe no other Arguments than his own Words, and by turning his own <hi>Cannon</hi> upon his <hi>Caſtle</hi> in the <hi>Air,</hi> I do not <hi>Queſtion,</hi> but to make him quit his Fortifications: The Truth is, I like his Title of <hi>Advocate,</hi> for he proves himſelf one, and acts the <hi>Advocate</hi> exactly, making the beſt he can of a bad Cauſe; but ſo great is <hi>Truth,</hi> that it needs no other <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,</hi> nor any better <hi>Arguments,</hi> than even in ſpeaking againſt her, he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to uſe for her. Pag. 41. <hi>The ancient Original Fundamental Laws,</hi> ſays he <hi>(by which other Laws of Leſs Extent are to be regulated,)</hi> were <hi>intended as a defence, and Protection to all; providing one injure not another, and that Common Peace and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be ſecured; No other Subſequent inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Law can therefore debar any peaceable
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56949:120"/>Chriſtian (that anſwers the Neceſſities of Church and State, Civil, Spiritual, and Political) in equal Juſtice, and in</hi> Foro Conſcientiae, <hi>from this Priviledge Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally due to all.</hi> And this he fortifies with the Confeſſion of a <hi>Presbyterian Divine,</hi> without a Name, <hi>who never ſaw any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument yet, that could clearly Evince, why any ſort of Men who would profeſs a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſubjection unto the Civil Government, might not in all their Civil Rights be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by it.</hi> Does not this oblige every Government to an eaſie <hi>Credulity,</hi> to its own Ruine? For the greateſt of its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will profeſs this Subjection, till they have power to effect their Ends; and by this <hi>Rule</hi> there is no care to be taken of Mens Principles or Practices, if they can but ſpeak Fair, and <hi>profeſs</hi> they mean no hurt to the Government; no matter for what may happen afterward; the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> may ſleep ſecurely, till their throats are cut by theſe harmleſs <hi>Profeſſors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT taking this for a <hi>Maxim</hi> granted, I proceed upon his own Words; That no <hi>Tolleration</hi> of different <hi>Religion</hi> is to be permitted, and that firſt from the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Rule (pag. 49.) <hi>Haſt thou Faith, have it to thy ſelf;</hi> And <hi>ſeeing that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity among Chriſtians is not to be attained, ſuch a Tolleration of things toller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, is not only Lawful, but neceſſary,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56949:120"/>where a Latitude or Liberty is left in ſuch things as are not clearly, and poſitively laid down in Scripture, in things of private Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</hi> Which is juſt giving that Liberty which no man can take away, every man being at liberty to believe and do ſo, ſo long as he keeps it to himſelf, and that it is Tollerable Faith by being to himſelf, and his practice is truly private. But why then does the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Command us to believe <hi>Supremacy, Purgatory, Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,</hi> &amp;c. which are not clearly, nor poſitively laid downin Scripture; is this Good, Juſt, and Equal dealing with us?</p>
               <p>BUT Secondly, I Argue from his own Reaſon, becauſe nothing is more clear than that this Tolleration muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity deſtroy that Original Fundamental Law of Protection, due to all from the Government; which will not be able to Protect it ſelf, ſince it muſt Embroyl the Government, and indanger its Ruine, that being the very thing for which Tollerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſo earneſtly deſired. <hi>For a Wiſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> (pag. 50, 51.) <hi>may tollerate</hi> (at leaſt in a private way) with the Old boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of giving what they cannot help, <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Opinions, when otherwiſe the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique may be intangled, or indangered, or rather becauſe the Conſcience cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, or Faith forced; and more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they be ſuch Religions, as do not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56949:121"/>the Foundations of Truth, nor ſuch as diſturb or impugn the Government Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht; or if the Profeſſors thereof be ſuch as are not Factious, or pertinacious, but Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, Simple, Tractable, Obedient to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, having no other End in holding their Opinions in Religion, than Gods Glory, or ſatisfaction of their own Conſcience; and withall are willing to ſubmit to better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when they are convinced to be Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous:</hi> (Pag. 52.) <hi>For we ought to have a Latitude of Charity for thoſe who Diſſent, if they be not Impoſtors, or turbulent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries.</hi> And who are there that will own themſelves to be ſuch? It looks like <hi>Oliver</hi> Remonſtrating; or a <hi>Declaration</hi> of 41. and by this <hi>Rule,</hi> all <hi>Sects, Hereſies,</hi> and Rebels, if they may be their own <hi>Compurgator<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> muſt be Tollerated too, ſince they will Profeſs all that is here deſired for <hi>Tolleration;</hi> but by clear <hi>Conſequence,</hi> if notwithſtanding theſe Profeſſions, they do intangle and indanger the Government, then they are not be <hi>Tollerated;</hi> but the <hi>Tolleration</hi> of all <hi>Sects,</hi> though Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſuppoſing them not <hi>Hereticks,</hi> does not only deſtroy ſome one Fundamental of Religion, but <hi>Religion</hi> in the Main; by making it Morally impoſſible for any Man to know where he ſhall find a true <hi>Religion,</hi> and plainly introduces <hi>Mahometaniſm,</hi> that a Man may be ſaved in any; and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56949:121"/>the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> and <hi>Libertine</hi> in their <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,</hi> that there is no ſuch thing, more than in Mens melancholy <hi>Humors.</hi> And it is impoſſible but the Profeſſors of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Religions will be Factious, and Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to Superiors, as daily Experience aſſures us; and to Tollerate them, is to give them leave to be ſo, and to hold their <hi>Opinions</hi> for the ſubverſion of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not ſatisfaction of <hi>Conſcience;</hi> as ſome who called themſelvs <hi>Papiſts</hi> as well as other Diſſenters have done in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, and, for ought we know, Deſign the ſame again; and therefore I conclude with the <hi>Advocate</hi> (p. 55.) <hi>That where eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one has Liberty to hold what he pleaſes;</hi> which by this profeſſion cannot be denied him; ſo ſoon as he believes his Party ſtrong enough to grapple with <hi>Authority, he will Publiſh and Preach what he holds, confined to no Rule or Order, but contemning Law, will Rule as a Tranſcendent,</hi> and as he quotes the moſt incomparable <hi>Hooker,</hi> (<hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 107.) <hi>Let them tell us of Obeying the Laws of God as long as they pleaſe, we dare not believe them who break the Laws of thoſe appointed by God to Rule over them. For it is a Diſtinction without a Difference, to ſeperate and divide the Laws of God from the Laws of Men; and unleſs we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve both, we Obey neither.</hi> (pag. 56.) <hi>In theſe Caſes,</hi> ſays our <hi>Advocate, Chriſtian
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56949:122"/>Governors are not to regard ſuch Pleas for private Liberty, as overthrow Publique Order and Peace. Nor to regard thoſe Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours againſt them and the Laws, as Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, when they do but oppoſe and reſtrain ſuch perillous Exorbitancies as ſtrike at the Foundation of Chriſtianity, and open a gap to Atheiſm, Profaneneſs, and Blaſphemy; here the Magiſtrate muſt interpoſe his Coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive Power for remedy: Nor are they in this infringers of the Peoples Liberty, but preſervers of freedom; not Oppreſſors of others Conſciences, but diſchargers of their own, by prohibiting men to vent their raw undigeſted Fancies to others; to ſtart Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples diſtructive to Government, ſubverting Order, violating Laws, breaking Oaths, and contemning Authority; publiquely act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to private Perſwaſion; not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding common Order, or publique Peace, but by a Seditious and Factious Liberty, broaching their Opinions to others.</hi> And there is a great deal of Reaſon why the Magiſtrate ſhould uſe this Power to cruſh the <hi>Cockatrice</hi> in the <hi>Egg: For</hi> (pag. 58.) <hi>if the publique Power ſhall ſuffer arrogant Ignorance, exceſs of Paſſion, perverſeneſs of Will, to come to its full Rudeneſs and Extent:</hi> (which it can do no way ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily as by Tolleration.) <hi>Tumultuary Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Brutiſh Power will ſoon make good private Preſumptions; and cover the moſt

               <p>WHAT can be ſaid more, or more ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt <hi>Tolleration</hi> than our <hi>Advocate</hi> here pleads; and to joyn Iſſue with him upon this Plea, if we can prove that theſe muſt be the Effects of Tolleration, then to uſe his own words, (pag. 62.) <hi>True Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Tolleration, not extending to matters of an Extern Nature, Magiſtrates may uſe a Coercive hindrance from Publique Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, without impeaching of it.</hi> (And, by his Favour, from private too, ſuch as he calls private; that is, in private houſes, which are as Capacious and Publique as ſome Churches.) <hi>For</hi> (adds he) <hi>Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Spirits, Cholerique Conſtitutions, and Feavouriſh Complexions, who love to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the troubled Waters of Secular Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, whoſe Heads are prone to move their

               <p>I need not repeat the Tumults of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor the Wars of <hi>Italy</hi> under <hi>Pope Boniface</hi> the Eighth, nor the Reign of <hi>Julius, John</hi> the 12. or 22. nor all the Diſturbances occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the Pride and Ambition of <hi>Popes</hi> graſping at Temporal Power and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty. Here is the <hi>Root</hi> of the Matter: This <hi>Canon</hi> which has ſtood unrepealed this 600 Years, is the perpetual Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Papal Uſurpations; to which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever does not Swear, upon Occaſion, muſt be a <hi>Heretick;</hi> and whoever does, muſt, if the <hi>Pope</hi> pleaſes, be a <hi>Rebel</hi> to his Prince, and againſt the Lord and his <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whoſe <hi>Goſpel</hi> teaches the quite contrary <hi>Doctrine.</hi> And though notwithſtanding this, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Princes, and even thoſe of <hi>Italy,</hi> as he ſays (<hi>pag.</hi> 202.) <hi>who live under the Pope's noſe, are not affraid of being Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or Excommunicated, but are Abſolute and Arbitrary in their Dominions.</hi> Thoſe laſt words are a good reaſon of their fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs for themſelves, but an ill one for their Subjects; and the ſubſequent words which he adds, a worſe for both, though ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to maintain their right: for they are not obliged to the Principles of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56949:126"/>the <hi>Roman Religion,</hi> or their Peoples Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, built upon the Sacred and Solemn <hi>Oaths of Allegiance,</hi> but are obliged to make the Sword give a Conſtant Security to the <hi>Sceptre; Whileſt they diſpute with Sword in hand for their Temporalities;</hi> So that it ſeems the <hi>Pope</hi> puts them upon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting their Right, and if the Sword of <hi>Princes</hi> be not longer than St. <hi>Peters,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> has the beſt Argument for even the Temporalities; and the <hi>Keys</hi> of the Kingdom of Heaven, can open a door to the Kingdoms of the <hi>Earth:</hi> Is not this a rare Principle of <hi>Peace,</hi> which obliges Princes to ſtand continually upon their Guard againſt the Incroachments of the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND whereas (<hi>pag.</hi> 215.) to ballance the Impious Doctrines of <hi>Bellarmine, Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez,</hi> and <hi>Mariana,</hi> he throws into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Scale, Luther, Calvin, Knox,</hi> and <hi>Buchanan;</hi> and tells us, <hi>That their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are at leaſt as dangerous to Monarchy, the difference between them being only this; That whereas the former lodg the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Power in the Pope only (whoſe perſon is at a ſafe and ſufficient diſtance at leaſt from us) the latter bring the danger home to the door of Princes, and place it in the People, whom they make both Parties and Judges in the Caſe.</hi> Neither the one therefore, nor the other, who maintain ſuch Doctrines,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56949:126"/>fit to be Tollerated by any <hi>Prince,</hi> who has not a mind to be depoſed either by the <hi>Pope</hi> or the <hi>People.</hi> But this diſtance, this ſafe diſtance was a prety ſweetning <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> to doſe a <hi>Prince,</hi> with the <hi>Opium</hi> of being out of Danger: As if <hi>Popes</hi> might not have as long hands now, and their <hi>Bulls</hi> as long Horns as in the days of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the 4 <hi>th.</hi> or <hi>Otho,</hi> or King <hi>John:</hi> And as if the <hi>Pope</hi> were not in the Caſe of thoſe Soveraigns, both Judg and Party; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that of <hi>Henry,</hi> where the Quarrel was, whether the <hi>Pope</hi> or the <hi>Prince</hi> had the Right of <hi>Inveſtitures</hi> of Biſhops to their Temporalities.</p>
               <p>BUT what if I ſhew him that <hi>Calvin, Luther,</hi> &amp;c. are as good Catholiques as he, in this Point of Veſting this depoſing Power in the <hi>People?</hi>

               <p>THUS I believe the Glorious <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> Three Perſons, but one <hi>God,</hi> the Incarnation of the Son of <hi>God,</hi> the proceeding of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> the Reſurrection of the <hi>Body,</hi> and the reſt of the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith; not becauſe I dare pretend to underſtand them, or to give a Satisfactory <hi>Reaſon</hi> to my ſelf, how this can be?

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1.</note> But the great Prerogative of Chriſtian <hi>Religion,</hi> is, <hi>That God, who at ſundry times, and in divers manners, ſpake in times paſt unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son; whom he hath appointed Heir of all things; by whom alſo he made the Worlds.</hi> Now theſe Holy Inſtruments, whom God employed to declare his Will to Men, that they might obtain Credit to their Meſſage, were aſſiſted with power of working <hi>Miracles,</hi> which were the Letters Teſtimonial, the <hi>Credentials</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> in their behalf, to aſſure the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous <hi>World,</hi> that they were Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Ambaſſadors from <hi>God;</hi> for it is a Natural Inference which <hi>Nicodemus</hi> made, even whileſt he was ſo Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, that he thought Regeneration an Impoſſibility.<note place="margin">

               <p>FROM this <hi>Poſtulatum</hi> granted, theſe Concluſions will Naturally follow; Firſt, <hi>That Faith does not depend upon Humane Authority, but upon Divine Revelation.</hi> For it came not by the Will of Man, but by the Will of <hi>God:</hi> And therefore no Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Authority</hi> has any power to Impoſe upon the Belief, any thing either contrary, or more than <hi>God</hi> has plainly revealed to

                  <hi>who is the Author and the Finiſher of our Faith.</hi> How great then is the Impiety of thoſe, who contrary to the practice of the Univerſal Church for 1500 years, have added the Books of <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> meer Humane Writings, to the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Canon,</hi> and under pain of Damnation Impoſe them upon us as matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> and Conditions of Salvation? How Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable is it to make <hi>Tradition</hi> the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>Faith,</hi> and of Equal value with the <hi>Holy Writings?</hi> Of which <hi>Traditions</hi> there being ſo great Uncertainty, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Improbable our Faith ſhould receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Confirmation from them: For what is liable to a doubt it ſelf, is very unlikely to take away all cauſe of Doubting.

               <p>SECONDLY, it follows, That nothing ought to be Impoſed as <hi>De Fide,</hi> and the Neceſſary Condition of Salvation, but what is clearly Demonſtrable to be the Will of <hi>God</hi> revealed; and which all Men, becauſe all are capacitated for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, may eaſily Underſtand to be ſo: And ſince all men have an Equal Title to

                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:56949:144"/>in Tranſubſtantion: For it is not enough to believe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is really preſent there; but I muſt give my ſenſes the Lye, which neither ſee him nor feel him (a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Faith than he required of St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>) I muſt diſcard my Reaſon, which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures me it is impoſſible that one Body ſhould be in <hi>Infinite</hi> Places at the ſame time, and believe how he is there Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally; or be a <hi>Heretick:</hi> Though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they who impoſe it upon me, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed among themſelves now it is, nor am I able to Underſtand what they mean; as the greateſt part of the <hi>Vulgar</hi> are inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated to receive ſuch Apprehenſions; and the moſt <hi>Learned</hi> are not able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them ſo as to be Underſtood.

               <p>AND therefore Thirdly, <hi>Faith</hi> muſt be reſolved into the firſt Principle of it, which is <hi>Gods</hi> Truth, and Infallibility, and that <hi>Word</hi> which I believe to be his, and therefore more Credible than the <hi>Word</hi> of any, or all Men. Thus was Faith firſt propagated in the World, and thus it muſt be increaſed; for the Multitudes to whom the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Preached throughout the <hi>World,</hi> did not believe St. <hi>Peter</hi> or St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that Preached <hi>Jeſus, and the Reſurrection, Righteouſneſs, Temperance,</hi> and Judgment to come; but ſeeing the <hi>Miracles</hi> which they did, they believed that this was the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the Son of God, agreable to the Doctrine of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> concerning the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> This Method our Lord made uſe of with his Diſciples.<note place="margin">

               <p>THIS will appear further, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Nature of a <hi>Rule;</hi> for a <hi>Rule</hi> is the conſtant, certain, infallible, unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able meaſure, according to which I judg of any thing, whether it be true or falſe.

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:56949:150"/>the Principles therein contained, I know by them that he is miſtaken, becauſe he he has not inſtructed me according to the <hi>Rule.</hi> The caſe is the ſame, only the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, being founded upon the Infallibility of <hi>God:</hi> They are the <hi>Rule,</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the Church, the <hi>Guides</hi> appointed by <hi>God</hi> for that purpoſe; to them therefore men reſort for Inſtruction; but if they teach either what is their own, or other mens, contrary to the <hi>Rule;</hi> they are falſe <hi>Guides;</hi> and why ſo?

               <p>BUT theſe People having no Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to a <hi>National</hi> Government, appear not ſo Dangerous to the State as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; nor ſo troubleſome as thoſe who contend for Soveraignty, and endeavour to pull down the <hi>Pillars</hi> of the Church, to Eſtabliſh their own <hi>Synagogue</hi> and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Sannedrim</hi> of Lay-Eccleſiaſticks; and whereas the other will be contented with a <hi>Chappel</hi> of Eaſe, theſe make the World Uneaſie, becauſe they may not have the <hi>Cathedral</hi> and Mother Church.

                  <hi>The Care of all the Churches, which came upon him daily</hi>) in his own perſon; he therefore takes Care that there ſhould be ſome left behind him who might; and <hi>Epheſus</hi> being one of the moſt Populous Cities of <hi>Aſia,</hi> in regard of the vaſt Concourſe of People from all Parts to the Famous Temple of <hi>Diana:</hi> and there being many Congregations of Chriſtians there, he having <hi>by the ſpace of two years continued there, ſo that all they who dwelt in</hi> Aſia <hi>heard the word of the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:56949:154"/>Lord Jeſus, both Jews and Greeks;</hi> he therefore ſends for the <hi>Presbyters</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in that <hi>City,</hi> by virtue of his <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical</hi> Authority; and there declares unto them, that for the time to come they were to take that care of the Churches which he had done: and that they might not do this of their own heads, or fear to do it for want of a Lawful Calling and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination;</hi> he declares the Will of <hi>God</hi> to them; and that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them to be <hi>Biſhops.</hi> So that they came indeed <hi>Presbyters</hi> to him, but they went away Biſhops from him; and Biſhops not of his own, but the <hi>Holy Ghoſts</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
               <p>IT is a Rule among Divines, <hi>That where the Literal ſenſe of Scripture is plain, we are to follow that.</hi> And that this is the plain <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> and Literal meaning of the Words, without the leaſt wreſting or violence offer'd to them, is moſt obvious: and that by this Power of Epiſcopacy, which the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> added to their former of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> they were to take the Care of the Government of the Church, as well in Ruling as Inſtructing, there are theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</p>
               <p>FIRST, When he ſends for them he calls them <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and not <hi>Biſhops,</hi> which, if there had been no difference, he might as well have done; and ſuppoſing that the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:56949:155"/>
                  <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> muſt foreſee that this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie would ariſe in the Church, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe he would contribute to it by ſuch an ambiguity, but the contrary, that they were only <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> calls them firſt, and then advanced to be <hi>Biſhops</hi> by his appointment.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, He puts the <hi>Government</hi> into their hands, by reſigning his own, in regard he was to ſee them no more.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, He directs them in their Office, which he divides into three Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. Firſt,<note place="margin">Verſ. <hi>28.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>To feed the Church of God, which he had purchaſed with his own Blood;</hi> to inſtruct them in the Faith and Doctrine of Chriſtian Religion. Secondly, To watch againſt Errors and Hereſies:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 29, 30, 31.</note> 
                  <hi>For I know this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that after my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, ſhall grievous Wolves enter in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, not ſparing the Flock: alſo of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw Diſciples after them; therefore Watch.</hi> Now, what ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies Vigilancy without Power? and what Power have the Watchmen, but to Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and Rebuke, and at laſt to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Obſtinate? And let them ſhew me this Power ever Exerciſed in the Church by any, beſides a Biſhop, and let them take the Cauſe. Thirdly, To Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Hoſpitality; to ſupport the <hi>Poor,</hi> and to <hi>remember the words of our Lord Jeſus,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:56949:155"/>how he ſaid, It is more bleſſed to give, than to receive.</hi> According to another Precept of his, in which he compriſes them all. <hi>For a Biſhop muſt be blameleſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2.</note> 
                  <hi>the husband of one wife, vigilant, ſober, of good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, given to hoſpitality; apt to teach.</hi> Laſtly, Here is no imperfect footſtep of their Solemn <hi>Conſecration,</hi> for when he had ended his Meſſage and Direction,<note place="margin">Verſ. <hi>36.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>When he had thus ſpoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND to manifeſt, that though every <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> be a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> yet every Presbyter is not a Biſhop; and that the Difference con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in Power and <hi>Rule,</hi> which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops have over the <hi>Presbyters</hi> as well as the reſt of the <hi>People,</hi> I doubt not to make moſt plain from <hi>Scripture</hi> and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. For,</p>
               <p>FIRST, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays Expreſly, That it is one qualification of a Biſhop;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>He muſt be one that ruleth well his own houſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Children in ſubjection with all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; for if a man know not how to rule his own houſe, how ſhall he take care of the Church of God?</hi> how ſhall he rule the houſe of God? and find me but one Example in <hi>Scripture,</hi> or ancient Church Hiſtory, where any one, who was not a Biſhop as well as a Presbyter, ever Exerciſed this Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of <hi>Ruling:</hi> the Presbyters had indeed a Rule, but with ſubordination to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:56949:156"/>the Biſhops.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Let the Presbyters that Rule well, be counted worthy of double Honor, eſpecially they who labour in the Word and Doctrine;</hi> (for anciently in the Church eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prieſt was not a <hi>Preacher,</hi> as is plain, not only from this place, but from the Church Hiſtory) but that the Presbyters might not be Exalted beyond their Bounds, to think this <hi>Rule</hi> equal to that of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops over the Church; he allays the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> in the very next words, and ſhews the the difference, the ſubordination, and ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which they owed to the <hi>Judicature</hi> of the Biſhop, as <hi>Timothy</hi> was there. <hi>Againſt a Presbyter, receive not an Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but before two or three Witneſſes,</hi> which is not ſpoken of Private Adom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>unleſs there be two or three Witneſſes, and them that ſin Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke openly, that others may fear.</hi> To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an Accuſation, plainly infers a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> a power to hear Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and according to their Depoſitions, to rebuke openly, is certainly an Effect of <hi>Authority.</hi> And he follows the blow cloſe, giving him another Direction about <hi>Ordination,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21, 22.</note> that he ſhould <hi>Lay hands ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly on no man, preferring one before another by Partiality.</hi> So that here is a diſtinct Power of a Biſhop from a Prieſt; To lay on hands, or Ordain, to receive Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt <hi>Presbyters,</hi> to Examine Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:56949:156"/>and according to their Teſtimony, to proceed to Judgment, to give Sentence openly; to Rebuke thoſe that Sin: even the <hi>Presbyters</hi> as well as others; for if they may be accuſed and convened, and found guilty of ſin, they alſo ought and may be rebuked and puniſhed: As to that place of the 5th <hi>Chap.

               <p>BY virtue of this Power it was that the <hi>Rulers</hi> of the Church ordered and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all things which were done, which were of an indifferent Nature in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

               <p>FIRST, That nothing impoſed ſhould be repugnant or contrary to any <hi>Article</hi> or Branch of <hi>Faith,</hi> or a Holy Life, or to any Cuſtoms of the Church recorded in <hi>Holy Writ.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>THIRDLY, That All might have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Concord,</hi> and that diverſity of <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>Opinions</hi> might not breed <hi>Schiſms</hi> and Contentions; and I ſhewed before, how when in ſome of theſe things there was a difference in ſeveral Churches, yet ſtill they held <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> one with another, maintaining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably the ſame Faith and <hi>Government</hi> in all.</p>
               <p>THIS was the Condition of the <hi>Church</hi> both as to Faith and <hi>Polity,</hi> till ſuch time as the great Powers of the Earth, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:56949:161"/>Emperours</hi> and other Kings became Chriſtians, and took up the <hi>Croſs</hi> of Chriſt as the Glory of their <hi>Crowns.</hi> The firſt of which was <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great. Theſe Temporal Powers then took the Church into their Protection, made Temporal <hi>Laws</hi> for the better Management of it, and to preſerve it from the Injuries of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Idolaters</hi> without, and <hi>Hereticks</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: and having the Sword in their hand, undertook, as it was their Duty, to puniſh Evil doers, who darſt tranſgreſs the Laws of the Church, with Temporal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as well as thoſe who broak the Laws of the <hi>Civil</hi> Magiſtrate; and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Peaceable and Religious. From the Bounty of theſe <hi>Princes,</hi> and that of others of plentiful Fortunes, and and by their <hi>Example,</hi> the Church came to be Endowed with <hi>Temporalties,</hi> and an Honourable, Conſtant, and Encouraging Maintainance was provided and ſettled upon thoſe who were to ſerve at the <hi>Altar;</hi> that ſo they might be inabled and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all ſorts of <hi>Learning,</hi> well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that proportionate <hi>Rewards</hi> are the ſpurs to Learning and Virtue, as the <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> for our Encouragement to Purſue and Obtain her, tells us,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>BY this it appears, That now there was a double <hi>Obligation</hi> laid upon all Chriſtians to be Obedient to the Commands of the Church; both becauſe they derive their Power from <hi>God,</hi> and becauſe the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Power did now concur to ſtrengthen the Duty by the Obligations of <hi>Humane Laws;</hi> nor can any thing, or any pretence of <hi>Conſcience</hi> authorize their Diſobedience to both thoſe Powers, unleſs the things commanded be manifeſtly proved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Faith, or be repugnant to good Life; which till <hi>Diſſenters</hi> can do, they will be obſtinate <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> before God, and <hi>Rebels</hi> againſt their <hi>Prince;</hi> and in a fair way to be <hi>Traytors.</hi> too; whilſt they break his Laws both <hi>Civil</hi> and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; however they may flatter themſelves with the Title of <hi>Saints.</hi> And ſo ſoon as they can prove their Charge againſt any of the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and that they are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in reality, and not only in ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they ſhall be gratified by their <hi>Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition,</hi> or amendment, if that will do.

               <p>As to what is matter of Faith, Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially Neceſſary to Salvation; That, <hi>God</hi> is the Sole <hi>Judg</hi> of himſelf: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it has by him long ſince been deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and received in the Church; and what ever by all muſt be believed, muſt be eaſy by all to be known, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore plainly ſet forth in <hi>Holy Scripture;</hi> Nor can any be <hi>Judg</hi> of this, but what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>Err,</hi> or deceive us, which is <hi>only God.</hi> And to ſay the Church is the <hi>Judg</hi>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:56949:164"/>of this, and that it cannot <hi>Err,</hi> becauſe the Catholique Church does not <hi>Err,</hi> is to argue Fallaciouſly, <hi>à non eſſe ad impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile eſſe:</hi> For that part of the Catholique <hi>Church,</hi> whileſt on Earth, conſiſting of Men, of whom ſome ſhall be ſaved, and ſome <hi>Reprobated;</hi> No man having a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to know which of them are thoſe who ſhall <hi>be kept by the power of God through Faith, unto Salvation,</hi> that they ſhall not Err, and to diſtinguiſh them from thoſe who ſhall not be ſo preſerved, and therefore there being a <hi>Poſſibility,</hi> that thoſe who may be <hi>Reprobates</hi> from the Faith them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, may yet be of great Authority in the Outward <hi>Viſible Church,</hi> it is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to admit them as <hi>Judges</hi> of Faith, who <hi>Erring</hi> themſelves, my lead us into <hi>Errors</hi> too. And therefore God, who ſpeaks to us in <hi>Scripture,</hi> is only the <hi>Judg</hi> of what is matter of Faith, and what not; and it is to be tryed by that Rule, and no Authority has power to impoſe any thing as matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> Eſſentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, but what is there to be found. The <hi>Harmony</hi> of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church, that ſuch things as are offered as matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> are agreeable to <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> is in things not clear and evident, the beſt <hi>Method</hi> to obtain Aſſent to them: As the diſagreement of the Church, is to ſuſpend our Belief: But this can only be
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:56949:165"/>about ſuch things as are collaterally of <hi>Faith,</hi> and by coming under the <hi>Notion</hi> of things <hi>Dubious,</hi> are matter of <hi>Opinion,</hi> and which if a man never knows, he may be ſaved, and therefore if he does not believe, he cannot be Damned, the Church is the <hi>Interpreter,</hi> but not the <hi>Judg;</hi> and indeed every man is a <hi>Judg</hi> for himſelf, by his Eyes, his Ears, his Reaſon and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, whether that which the Church <hi>Interprets,</hi> be according to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> the <hi>Rule of that Faith</hi> by which he is to be ſaved, and which therefore it is neceſſary that he know before he believe it to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>BUT ſince doubts are of divers Natures, <hi>Private</hi> and Publique; let us ſee how any Perſon may be determined in both. Firſt therefore, Where the doubt is only <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,</hi> about things not determined by <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Authority</hi> derived from Scripture, which are of an Indifferent <hi>Nature,</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Mans full perſwaſion is his <hi>Judg,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt Evidence the things in doubt admit of from the light of Nature, Reaſon, or probability that they are good and Lawful, or Evil and Unlawful. This full Perſwaſion St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Faith, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not of Faith, is Sin;</hi> that is, what I am not fully perſwaded in my own mind of the Lawfulneſs of, I cannot lawfully do. This was the Caſe of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:56949:165"/>who having only the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> were a Law to themſelves, their thoughts either Accuſing or Excuſing them, as they acted according to the beſt of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and full <hi>Perſwaſion.</hi> But this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is only <hi>Private,</hi> and has nothing to do with any other Perſon. <hi>Haſt thou Faith, have it to thy ſelf; who art thou that Judgeſt anothe? Happy is he that Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not himſelf in that which he alloweth.</hi> This is the <hi>Error</hi> of our Times, men will make their <hi>Private perſwaſions</hi> Judges of all other men, and impoſe their <hi>Private Opinions</hi> as matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> neceſſary to Salvation. Againſt which the whole Scope of that whole <hi>14th.</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Romans</hi> is deſigned.</p>
               <p>BUT there is alſo another <hi>Private Judg,</hi> whom God has appointed, with Refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to things both of <hi>Private</hi> and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Concern, and that is <hi>Conſcience;</hi> the Rule of <hi>Conſcience</hi> is the Scripture, the meaſure of <hi>Conſcience</hi> is the certainty of Knowledg, and the Judgment of <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is the determination of the Mind, and the Direction of our Practice according to it. For thus I and every man <hi>Judges;</hi> I therefore believe the <hi>Articles</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, that I am to do good to All men, to be Obedient to <hi>God,</hi> and my Lawful Superiors, to live Righteouſly, ſoberly, and <hi>Godly</hi> in this preſent <hi>World;</hi> becauſe
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:56949:166"/>I certainly know that theſe things are by <hi>God</hi> commanded in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not ſo in plain Words or Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, is only matter of <hi>Opinion</hi> and not of <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Certainty of Knowledg, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Eſſence of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> as Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is of the Eſſence of <hi>Opinion.</hi>

               <p>BUT Secondly, In regard this very <hi>Rule</hi> is, in things of Publique Doubt and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, in ſome things <hi>Dubious,</hi> ſuch as is the Controverſie about Government: And ſince the <hi>Holy Oracles</hi> may ſeem to admit of Diverſe interpretations, ſo that what ſatisfies one mans Judgment, is quite <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite</hi> and contrary to another: We muſt inquire who are to be <hi>Judges</hi> and Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Rule</hi> in theſe <hi>Publique</hi> Affairs? For that there muſt be ſome Judg or Judges, is plain, becauſe <hi>God</hi> commands <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and Obedience, but theſe cannot be obtained without men be determined What and Whom to Obey.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> informs us,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.</note> That it is not the Duty of <hi>Private</hi> men, <hi>For no Scripture is of private Interpretation,</hi> and ſhews us the danger: Notwithſtanding which, bold men will venture at it, as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſays of his days,<note place="margin">Hier.

                  <hi>Scripturarum Ars eſt, quam paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſim omnes ſibi vendicant, hanc Garrula anus, hanc delirus Senex, hanc Sophiſta verboſus, hanc univerſi preſumunt, lacerant, docent antequam diſcant.</hi> It ſeems in his time, all
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:56949:166"/>people read the Scriptures. For every prating Old Woman, and Doating Old Man, every Wrangling wordy Sophiſter, challenges and preſumes to tear the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> in pieces, and to teach others before they have learnt themſelves. Whereas theſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calls them, Unlearned, ungrounded People ought firſt to Learn. But of whom? There is but this Choice, either this Power is in the People, or in the Governors of the Church.</p>
               <p>IT cannot be in the <hi>People,</hi> for they are <hi>Private</hi> Perſons, and are incapacitated by being ſo, to perform this <hi>Publique Office,</hi> for what no one can do ſingly, neither can all do Collectively; what every man wants, all muſt: For if every man in the World had but one Eye, all the World muſt want two. And the People are to Obey in Learning, and therefore not to <hi>Rule</hi> in Teaching: Neither would it be poſſible to come to any Determination in any thing; it being impoſſible to find all the People of one <hi>Nation, City,</hi> Village, or Family; Nay, even one Perſon of the ſame mind, for any continuance of Time; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, all Religion muſt ſtagger and totter with continual Changes, Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, and Alterations, and at laſt fall to Ruine and Confuſion: Which Great Truth forced even <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf to drop
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:56949:167"/>this <hi>Oracle,</hi> ſo contrary to the Pretences of his now Followers, who would have the Fences of Government, which incloſes <hi>Gods Vineyard,</hi> thrown down, and all laid Common by <hi>Tolleration and Liberty of Conſcience:</hi>

                  <hi>Quantarum Rixarum</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſemen futura ſit Earum Rerum Confuſio; ſi prout cuique libitum ſit, mutare liceat quae ad communem Statum pertinent? Quando nunquam futurum eſt ut omnibus idem pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat, ſi res velut in medio Poſitae ſingulorum arbitrio relictoe fuerint.

               <p>THE <hi>Scripture</hi> muſt be Interpreted, and is not of <hi>Private</hi> Interpretation, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, but that it is of <hi>Publique.</hi> God
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:56949:167"/>commands <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> but in doing ſo he would command an <hi>Impoſſibility,</hi> if he had not appointed <hi>Means</hi> to obtain it; to whom then can this Power be delegated to draw all mens private <hi>Opinions</hi> into one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Rule</hi> for Practice, but to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the Church, which all ſhall be bound to obſerve for the obtaining Peace and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> I have already proved who are thoſe Governors, who by the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> are to Rule, to feed the Flock of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to Watch over mens Souls, as they that muſt give an Account, to Rebuke, Exhort, with all long ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but not with ſuffering always; for if Seducers will perſiſt in ſubverting houſes, and vain talking, then by proceeding to ſtopping their Mouths; that ſo they may <hi>ſtudy to approve themſelves unto God, Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that need not be aſhamed, rightly divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Word of Truth.</hi> And the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Power of the <hi>Civil</hi> Magiſtrate may aſſiſt the Spiritual to bring men to Peace, Unity, and Obedience to theſe their Guides and Governors, by being a Terror to Evil doers, and Encouragement to thoſe who do well, which is both the <hi>Will</hi> and the <hi>Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know it will be Objected, That theſe <hi>Intepreters</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and Judges of Controverſies may <hi>Err,</hi> and be deceived, <hi>Biſhops</hi> may Err, <hi>Counſels</hi> have Erred,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:56949:168"/>and therefore this leaves us ſtill in an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, ſince it is poſſible that we may be miſled by them; and how ſhall we be certain they do not <hi>Err,</hi> or we in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them? and wherein is it Lawful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to <hi>Obey</hi> them?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, That the <hi>Qualificatîon</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Guide</hi> and Interpreter of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> as we are to expect, is not ſuch a one as cannot <hi>Err,</hi> but ſuch a one as does not Err; for had <hi>God</hi> left us ſuch a <hi>Guide,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his own Word and Will, there would have been a ſtate of <hi>Perfection</hi> attainable in this Life, and by conſequence an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and no neceſſity of his <hi>Divine</hi> aſſiſtance to keep us by his mighty Power from falling through Faith unto Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; ſuch a <hi>Guide</hi> muſt have been <hi>a God, Omniſcient Omnipotent, and Omnipreſent;</hi> which is as unreaſonable to believe as to expect from any or all <hi>Mortal</hi> Men. And beſides, it is a vain and frivolous <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> for thoſe who are under any Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Government to run into the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous <hi>Errors,</hi> and manifeſt breach of <hi>Gods</hi> Command, by <hi>Schiſm</hi> and Diſobedience to the Laws of Men, for fear of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry danger of future <hi>Errors;</hi> which if they ſhall really happen, we have a plain and eaſy remedy againſt them, if we know them to be ſuch; and that is in our own perſons to proteſt againſt them, and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:56949:168"/>to refuſe to Joyn with thoſe that hold them; and if we know them not to be ſo, though we be in <hi>Error</hi> (as who lives that does not <hi>Err?</hi>) they will do us no injury, for it is obſtinacy in <hi>Error,</hi> and not bare <hi>Error</hi> of ignorant frailty that is damnable: but we can have no <hi>Plea</hi> or Excuſe to make to <hi>God</hi> Almighty for our <hi>Error</hi> of Separation, breach of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> Peace, Order, Communion, Diviſion from a Church not yet convicted of any manifeſt <hi>Error</hi> either in <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> which is the Caſe between Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, every <hi>Error</hi> in Circumſtantials which does not deſtroy <hi>Faith</hi> or a good Life, is not a ſufficient and warrantable Cauſe for any private Man to throw off all Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his Superiors; for if it were, there could be no ſuch thing as a <hi>Catholique</hi> Church, or <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> there being no particular Men, or any <hi>Society</hi> of Men without <hi>Sins,</hi> and by conſequence not without <hi>Errors,</hi> both in Doctrine and Practice.</p>
               <p>BUT Secondly, The Governours of the Church neither do nor can <hi>Err</hi> in point of Faith and Doctrine, or Diſcipline and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſo long as they follow the <hi>Rule</hi> of the Scriptures in Caſes plain and clear, as before I ſhewed the Matters of <hi>Faith</hi> eſſentially neceſſary to Salvation are. Nor
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:56949:169"/>ſo long as they <hi>Judge</hi> of ſuch as are dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, according to their <hi>Catholiqueneſs,</hi> in the Eſteem of all Ages of the Church, for no Error was ever Univerſal. And though they may be miſtaken, yet do they not <hi>Err,</hi> if in <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and obſcure places of <hi>Scripture,</hi> they indeavour to Expound the meaning of them by others which are more clear and perſpicuous, following the received ſenſe of them acknowledged ſo by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church;</hi> ſo long as in thoſe Interpretations there can be nothing repugnant to the Common <hi>Faith</hi> of Chriſtians, or prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to <hi>Peace, Charity</hi> and <hi>Practical Piety.</hi> Neither can they <hi>Err</hi> as to the point of Diſcipline, and the External <hi>Polity</hi> of the Church, if in indifferent things in their own <hi>Natures,</hi> and not Eſſentially neceſſary to Salvation, they do not impoſe them as ſuch; if they follow the Direction of the General Rules of the <hi>Holy Canon,</hi> that every thing be done with reſpect to Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Order, Edification, for the avoiding Confuſion, and obtaining Peace, Unity, and Chriſtian Love, according to the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi> of the beſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in former <hi>Ages</hi> in the Church; and the <hi>Canons</hi> of ſuch Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Counſels</hi> as are not found manifeſtly Guilty of <hi>Partiality</hi> and Corruption in the long Train of <hi>Errors,</hi> which the Indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to Erect the Primacy into a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:56949:169"/>and the Supremacy into a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> has brought into the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIRDLY, If the Governors of the <hi>Church</hi> Impoſe any thing contrary to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, Faith, or Holy Life, then do they forſake the <hi>Rule,</hi> and it is Lawful and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for every good Chriſtian to forſake them; for ſo is St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Be ye followers of me, as I am of God.</hi> And prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them for obſerving the Commandments delivered to them by God. But if they fall from the Faith, as did the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> the <hi>Manichees,</hi> the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we are not then to be Followers of them, but <hi>Followers of God, as Dear Children.</hi> But if any Private man, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſhall think, becauſe in ſome things which are contrary to their apprehenſion, that therefore the Determinations are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Scripture,</hi> and therefore their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience not due, it is a miſtake, for they muſt be certain, otherwiſe they are bound to be ſubject; for if they be not certain, and from the beſt Grounds and clear Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, it is but their <hi>Opinion,</hi> which cannot weigh enough in the Scale of Truth, to warrant their Diſobedience againſt the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique <hi>Opinion</hi> of their Superiors, but that ſuch a Diſobedience will be a certain <hi>Sin:</hi> for if any, or many mens Private <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:56949:170"/>which is private <hi>Interpretation,</hi> may authorize them to renounce their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Superiors, there can never be any ſuch thing as ſubjection in the World, nor any Government, and by good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, No <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> no <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> and then no <hi>Faith,</hi> and in ſhort, at laſt no ſuch thing as <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OTHERS will Object, That hereby I ſeem to introduce <hi>Romiſh</hi> Infallibility, and make our Biſhops <hi>Lords</hi> of our Faith; and that we had better ſubmit to one <hi>Pope,</hi> who is as free from <hi>Error</hi> as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhops.</p>
               <p>To this I Anſwer, That there is nothing more contrary to Senſe or Truth than ſuch an <hi>Objection.</hi> For I do not make, nor believe them Infallible, but the <hi>Rule</hi> by which they are to Govern, which is the Word of the <hi>Infallible God,</hi> who cannot lye or be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and, I ſuppoſe, that they may act contrary to this <hi>Rule,</hi> and that preſumes they are not Infallible; but if they follow the <hi>Rule,</hi> then I ſay they cannot <hi>Err;</hi> and ſhould the <hi>Pope</hi> do ſo, all Chriſtians over whom he may Challenge a lawful Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as their <hi>Patriarch,</hi> ought to ſubmit to him: But it is Evident, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church does <hi>Err,</hi> and has Erred in many things, forſaking the <hi>Rule,</hi> ſetting up the Authority of the <hi>Pope</hi> to alter and change
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:56949:170"/>that <hi>Rule,</hi> by introducing new <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> new Books of Scripture, and old <hi>Traditions,</hi> his own <hi>Canons,</hi> Decretals, and Councels for a <hi>Rule;</hi> nay, his own <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, his Sentence and Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for an Infallible <hi>Rule</hi> of Faith and Life, which is as far from me to believe of our Biſhops, as to ſay or believe it of him.</p>
               <p>NOR does this <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of Biſhops either take away that ſubordination which for convenience of Government is among them, or intrench upon the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the <hi>Civil</hi> Magiſtrate: ſince his <hi>Supremacy</hi> conſiſts in a <hi>Temporal Soveraignty,</hi> and pretends not to any <hi>Paſtoral Power,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch <hi>Kingly</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Authority in Caſes Eccleſiaſtical, as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religious <hi>Emperors</hi> had and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, to whom even <hi>Popes</hi> as well as other <hi>Patriarchs</hi> yielded ſubjection; as I can make appear out of the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great to <hi>Mauritius,</hi> and the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorians,</hi> in a hundred pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And nothing is more plain, than that <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf owned a Subjection, as well as Commanded one to <hi>Ceſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Civil</hi> Magiſtrate and his Power, I think nothing more Evident than the Duty all their Subjects, whether <hi>Laicks</hi> or Eccleſiaſticks, owe them; and that they
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:56949:171"/>have <hi>Preſcription,</hi> the Law of <hi>God, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Nations,</hi> and thoſe of their own on their ſide, for the Defence of their Titles to their Crowns and <hi>Scepters;</hi> and that the Church and Faith is and ought to be their Particular <hi>Care,</hi> as well as it is their <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,</hi> the quiet of the State ever depending in a great Meaſure upon the <hi>Peace</hi> of the Church; and that they have a <hi>Coercive</hi> Power, by virtue of which they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel men to Obedience to the Laws both <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> which in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Law of <hi>God</hi> are to promote the <hi>Peace,</hi> Happineſs, Unity, and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their <hi>People.</hi> Nor was this Doctrine ever deni'd till the <hi>Papacy</hi> growing great, and the <hi>Empire</hi> declining, began to think of a <hi>Temporal</hi> as well as a <hi>Spiritual Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> and to Unite St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Sword to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Keys.</hi> And till the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> reviving the Hereſy of <hi>Aerius</hi> and his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Principle, began to indeavour to ſet up their Spiritual <hi>Democracy</hi> in the Church, in order to their Erecting it alſo in the <hi>State;</hi> as the ſad <hi>Probatum</hi> which they writ to their late deadly of the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant</hi> might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, without the dangerous neceſſity of a ſecond <hi>Experiment.
